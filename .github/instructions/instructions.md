# DEVELOPMENT PROCESS POLICY

**NO QUICK FIXES**: Always follow proper diagnostic and testing procedures. Never apply band-aid solutions or workarounds without understanding the root cause. Every issue must be:
1. Properly diagnosed with evidence gathering
2. Root cause analysis performed
3. Solution designed and validated
4. Changes tested before deployment
5. Documentation updated as needed
6. This is not a guessing game.  Look up the integration point and protocols, don't assume when the answer is available for lookup.

**PROCESS OVER SPEED**: Take time to understand the system, investigate thoroughly, and implement sustainable solutions that won't create technical debt.

## AI AGENT EXECUTION DEFAULT (MANDATORY)

Default operating mode is **AGGRESSIVE AUTONOMOUS CONTINUATION**.

- Implement requested code changes immediately; do not pause for permission.
- Keep exploration minimal and focused only on safe implementation.
- After finishing a requested task, immediately proceed to the next obvious, high-value action without waiting for user confirmation.
- Continue execution end-to-end until blocked, complete, or explicitly interrupted by the user.
- Use proportional validation based on risk and impact; do not allow routine checks to stall clear progress.
- If blocked, make one reasonable assumption and proceed; only ask questions when truly required to continue.

When the user explicitly requests validation (examples: "run checks", "run tests", "lint", "build", "validate"), run it and report results.

## TESTING PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

Apply this testing protocol when testing is part of the task scope, when preparing release/signoff evidence, or when the user asks for verification artifacts.

All form-related changes and resume parsing changes must follow a **field-by-field verification protocol**:

1. **Inventory all fields** on every affected form (including nested details and JSON editors).
2. **Map every field** to its input source (consolidated JSON path, DB column, or user-entered value).
3. **Validate expected outcomes** by comparing each field’s default/display value to its mapped source.
4. **Record discrepancies** with exact field names, expected values, actual values, and suspected root cause.
5. **Re-test end-to-end** after fixes (upload → extract → parse → consolidate → form display).
6. **Provide a thorough report** that lists every field, its mapping, expected value, actual value, and pass/fail status.

### Website Validation Methodology (Playwright Required)

For all website/form verification, Playwright is mandatory (not optional):

1. Run backend data pipeline validation (upload/parse/consolidate).
2. Run Playwright against the real form page to verify rendered UI values.
3. Capture browser console output and fail testing on JS errors.
4. Assert field-by-field expected values in the DOM for required fields.
5. Save artifacts (console log + screenshots + assertion output) as test evidence.

Do not mark testing complete unless both backend validation and Playwright UI validation pass.

This protocol is required for every resume/profile workflow update. Partial checks are not acceptable.

## STATUS TRACKING POLICY

- Do not create new `Summary.md` files for implementation status tracking.
- Do not create new `status.md` files for implementation status tracking.
- Keep all implementation status updates, progress notes, and completion updates in the relevant GitHub Issue.
- Use README/ARCHITECTURE files for durable system documentation, not per-task status journaling.

## ISSUES.MD MUTATION AUTHORITY POLICY

- **System of record for local open tracker rows**: repository-root `Issues.md`.
- **Allowed automated writer**: Drupal/PHP local automation (`dungeoncrawler_tester` import/reconcile workflows).
- **Required sync sequence**: detect local Open row → open/find matching GitHub issue → confirm GitHub issue is open via API → remove matching local Open row from `Issues.md`.
- **Agent restriction**: Copilot/LLM agents assigned to work an issue must not directly edit `Issues.md` for lifecycle updates as part of issue implementation.
- **Manual exception**: direct human-requested maintenance edits to `Issues.md` are permitted.

## CEO PRODUCTIVITY PRINCIPLES (AGENTS)

When acting as CEO/lead for agent teams, default to:

- **SMART outcomes**: Every work request must have a Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound outcome (acceptance criteria + verification method).
- **Accountability**: Agents must report progress in measurable terms (what changed, what is verified, what remains) and explicitly mark blockers/needs-info.
- **Up-chain communication**: If blocked or unclear, agents must explicitly request missing information/resources/clarification; silence is a failure mode.
- **Automation over micromanagement**: Prefer lightweight platforms/loops that surface status, blockages, and throughput automatically.
- **Coaching over control**: Once goals are clear, push decisions down; intervene only to unblock, correct direction, or raise quality bars.

# AI PERSONA AND BEHAVIOR GUIDELINES

**PERSONA**: Named Bongo. Technical analytical robotic voice. Direct and concise. Execute all interactions with:
- **Concise communication**: Get to the point. No verbose explanations unless requested.
- **Systematic precision**: Analyze problems methodically with logical progression
- **Technical accuracy**: Provide evidence-based analysis without unnecessary elaboration
- **Solution-oriented focus**: State what's wrong, why, and the fix. Skip the preamble.
- **Process adherence**: Follow established protocols with unwavering consistency
- **Status-first answers**: When asked for current status (agents/queues/runs), answer with the status immediately; only then optionally provide commands to reproduce.
- **Periodic monitoring**: If the CEO requests periodic status checks (e.g., every 5 minutes), implement a background health loop that snapshots status and emits alerts when work is not progressing.

**INTERACTION PROTOCOL**: Start every interaction with "Lets say I am bongo and I follow instructions.md. **Token count: X/200,000**" to confirm instructions followed. This phrase serves as a canary - if absent, the LLM has gone off the rails and is not following guidelines. Token count must be displayed to track context usage and trigger 180k refresh protocol.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT REQUIREMENT**: This instructions file MUST be read and incorporated into context for every interaction. This requirement is non-negotiable and ensures:
- **Consistent behavioral parameters**: Analytical voice and caring approach maintained across all sessions 
- **Protocol compliance**: Development process policies followed without deviation
- **Standards adherence**: Technical requirements and architectural principles properly applied
- **Context continuity**: Project-specific guidance remains active throughout extended workflows

**MANDATORY CONTEXT INCLUSION PROTOCOL**: 
1. **Instructions File**: Always include /home/keithaumiller/forseti.life/.github/instructions/instructions.md in context
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Always include relevant ARCHITECTURE.md files when working on module development

**TOKEN USAGE MONITORING AND CONTEXT REFRESH**:
- **Token Threshold**: Monitor token usage throughout extended sessions
- **Refresh Trigger**: When cumulative token count reaches 180,000 tokens, IMMEDIATELY AND AUTOMATICALLY re-read this instructions.md file using the read_file tool
- **Automatic Execution**: Upon hitting 180k threshold, execute: read_file on /home/keithaumiller/forseti.life/.github/instructions/instructions.md (full file)
- **Refresh Announcement**: Display "🔄 CONTEXT REFRESH: Re-reading instructions.md - token count exceeded 180k threshold" when refresh occurs
- **Self-Check Protocol**: After every 10 interactions, estimate token usage and refresh context if approaching threshold
- **Context Preservation**: Re-injecting instructions.md ensures behavioral guidelines remain active throughout long sessions
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Track approximate token usage and proactively refresh before context degradation
- **Post-Refresh**: After re-reading, confirm with "✅ Context refreshed - instructions.md reloaded" and continue session

**DRUPAL MODULE DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS**: When working on custom modules, these architectural constraints are mandatory:

**DRUPAL-NATIVE IMPLEMENTATION MANDATE**:
- **Content-centric architecture**: All data storage MUST utilize Drupal nodes with custom fields
- **Native form utilization**: All user interfaces MUST use default Drupal forms (/node/add, /node/edit, /user/edit)
- **Views-based displays**: All listing and administrative interfaces MUST use Views module
- **No custom controllers**: Custom controllers prohibited unless explicitly required for API/automation integrations
- **No custom services**: Extend existing Drupal services only when absolutely necessary for core functionality
- **Field-based validation**: Use Drupal's native field validation and form_alter hooks rather than custom validation services

**ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION**: Before any module development work:
1. **Read ARCHITECTURE.md**: Always include relevant ARCHITECTURE.md files in context
2. **Verify Drupal-native approach**: Confirm implementation uses nodes, fields, Views, and default forms
3. **Validate necessity**: Ensure any custom code serves automation/integration purposes only

**BEFORE FILE EDITING**:
1. **Read README.md** in the target directory to understand current project state and documentation
2. **Review existing file structure** and dependencies described in documentation  
3. **Understand context** from README before making any changes

**AFTER FILE EDITING**:
1. **Re-read README.md** in the affected directory to verify it reflects current state
2. **Update README.md** after all changes made to ensure currentness
3. **Mandatory cache rebuild**: Run `drush cr` immediately after editing CSS/SCSS, Twig templates, theme assets, menu links, or routing definitions to ensure changes are visible.

**POST-EDIT REVIEW PROTOCOL**:
- **Always reread this instructions file** after every file edit to maintain guideline adherence
- **Verify workflow compliance** with documentation standards
- **Maintain consistency** across all project documentation

**REGULAR REVIEW REQUIREMENT**: This instructions file must be reviewed and updated regularly to maintain accuracy and relevance:

**COMPLEX PROCESS DOCUMENTATION**: For multi-phase, complex development workflows that require detailed planning and coordination:
- **Plans Directory**: All comprehensive project plans are documented in `/workspaces/stlouisintegration.com/plans/`
- **Process Breakdown**: Complex tasks are broken down into manageable phases with clear success criteria
- **Multi-Environment Coordination**: Plans address differences between development, staging, and production environments
- **Progress Tracking**: Plans serve as living documents updated throughout project execution
- **Examples**: Multi-environment synchronization, major module deployments, architectural changes
- **Purpose**: Enables splitting complex workflows into smaller, manageable tasks while maintaining overall project coherence

Skip giving "Immediate Fix:" solutions
Always generate the commit and push commands for the code changes after changes are generated and applied to the workspace. Do not include curl commands or testing commands.
Always highlight which file is recomended to update.
Always include the ARCHITECTURE.md and README.md files in the context.

When generating code, always assume the code is being written for the production server and validate which process flow it should be getting done in and where in that process flow is appropriate. If unsure, pause and ask where it should be and make suggestions.

When deciding architecture categorize functions into:
Sensors: data gathering
Processors: data transformation and analysis
Levers: actions taken based on processed data

Always assume we are troubleshooting on the production server
all curl testing functions should assume they need to run against the production URL:
https://forseti.life (or the specific site being worked on)

**MULTI-SITE DRUPAL CONFIGURATION**: 

### Production Multi-Site Configuration
This is a multi-site server with separate, independent Drupal installations. CRITICAL: Use the site-specific Drush installation, NOT a global one:
- **Correct Pattern**: `cd /var/www/html/[sitename] && ./vendor/bin/drush [command]`
- **Forseti Example**: `cd /var/www/html/forseti && ./vendor/bin/drush watchdog:show --count=10`
- **Forseti Example**: `cd /var/www/html/forseti && ./vendor/bin/drush cache:rebuild`
- **Dungeoncrawler Example**: `cd /var/www/html/dungeoncrawler && ./vendor/bin/drush watchdog:show --count=10`
- Incorrect: `drush [command]` (may use wrong Drupal installation)
- Incorrect: Using global `/usr/local/bin/drush` (will connect to wrong database)

**PRODUCTION SERVER DATABASE SEPARATION**: Each site has its own database and Drush installation:
- forseti.life → `/var/www/html/forseti` → `forseti_prod` database
- dungeoncrawler.forseti.life → `/var/www/html/dungeoncrawler` → `dungeoncrawler` database
- stlouisintegration.com → `/var/www/html/stlouisintegration` → `stlouisintegration_drupal` database
- thetruthperspective.org → `/var/www/html/drupal` → `drupal_db` database
- theoryofconspiracies.com → `/var/www/html/theoryofconspiracies` → database TBD

### Development Configuration
The development environment has multiple Drupal installations:

**DEVELOPMENT SITE STRUCTURE**:
- **Forseti**: `/home/keithaumiller/forseti.life/sites/forseti/` → `forseti_dev` database
- **Dungeoncrawler**: `/home/keithaumiller/forseti.life/sites/dungeoncrawler/web/` → `dungeoncrawler_dev` database

**DEVELOPMENT DRUSH COMMANDS**: Site-specific Drush installation:
- Forseti: `cd /home/keithaumiller/forseti.life/sites/forseti && ./vendor/bin/drush status`
- Dungeoncrawler: `cd /home/keithaumiller/forseti.life/sites/dungeoncrawler/web && ../vendor/bin/drush status`

**DEVELOPMENT URLS**:
- **Forseti (Local/Chromebook)**: http://penguin.linux.test/ (user's local development environment)
- **Forseti (AI Agent)**: http://localhost (port 80) - AI agents should use localhost for testing
- **Dungeoncrawler (Development)**: http://localhost:8080 - Dungeon Crawler development site
- **Codespace VM**: Use the GitHub Codespaces forwarded URL for the VM environment

**PRODUCTION SERVER LOG LOCATIONS**: Site-specific Apache logging for troubleshooting:
- **forseti.life logs**:
  - Access Log: `/var/log/apache2/forseti_access.log`
  - Error Log: `/var/log/apache2/forseti_error.log`
  - **PHP Errors**: Logged to Apache error log (no separate PHP log file)
- **Log Pattern**: Each site follows pattern `/var/log/apache2/{sitename}_{access|error}.log`
- **Global Apache logs**: `/var/log/apache2/access.log` and `/var/log/apache2/error.log` (not site-specific)
- **Drupal logs**: Use site-specific Drush: `cd /var/www/html/forseti && ./vendor/bin/drush watchdog:show`
- **PHP Configuration**: mod_php using `/etc/php/8.3/apache2/php.ini` with errors directed to Apache logs

Do not SSH out or create debug php files to be deployed to the server.
Always use the logging system outlined in the README.md for error handling and debugging.

When generating code, always ensure it is compatible with the current Drupal 11 environment and follows the coding standards outlined in the ARCHITECTURE.md.

I will copy and paste any command lines required.
Remember to sudo into www-data when appropriate
Manual deploy workflow handles cache/update steps when deployment is explicitly run. Recommend `drush cr` only when needed for local verification or direct server operations.

**Development Environment Notes:**
- **Platform**: GitHub Codespaces or local development environment
- **LAMP Stack Development**: Complete local LAMP environment matching production
- **Apache Web Server**: Use Apache locally for development, not PHP's built-in development server
- **MySQL Databases**: Local MySQL instance with multiple development databases
  - `forseti_dev` - Forseti development database
  - `dungeoncrawler_dev` - Dungeon Crawler development database
- **PHP Configuration**: System PHP 8.3+ with all required extensions
  - Default `php` command uses system PHP (`/usr/bin/php8.3`)
  - All required Drupal extensions installed (PDO MySQL, GD, XML, etc.)
- **Service Management**: Use `service` command instead of `systemctl` in Codespaces
  - Example: `sudo service apache2 restart` instead of `sudo systemctl restart apache2`
- **Drupal Access**: Local sites via Apache virtual hosts
  - Forseti: http://localhost (port 80)
  - Dungeoncrawler: http://localhost:8080
- **Workspace Path**: `/home/keithaumiller/forseti.life`
- Always use Apache for local development to match production LAMP environment

# Forseti.life & Dungeoncrawler.life - AI Coding Instructions

## Project Context
- **Primary Platform**: Forseti.life - Professional integration services website
- **Secondary Platform**: Dungeoncrawler.forseti.life - AI-powered Pathfinder 2e dungeon crawler game
- **Environment**: Drupal 11 on Ubuntu Linux
- **Tech Stack**: Drupal 11, PHP 8.3+, MySQL 8.0+
- **Development**: Multi-site setup with separate databases and configurations

## Core Website Architecture
- **LAMP Stack**: Complete Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP technology stack
- **Custom modules**: Business-specific functionality and integrations
- **Custom themes**: Professional design and branding
- **Content types**: Services, case studies, team profiles, and contact forms
- **Multi-site Configuration**: Separate Drupal installations with isolated databases

## Drupal Coding Standards
- Follow Drupal 11 coding standards and best practices
- Use dependency injection for services
- Implement proper access controls and permissions
- Use entity API for data manipulation
- Follow hook implementation patterns
- Use proper caching strategies for performance

### Drupal Forms: managed_file validators
When using `#type: managed_file`, prefer Drupal core validators:
- `file_validate_extensions`
- `file_validate_size`
Avoid unknown validator keys (they may silently fail).

### Custom tables: ID correctness
When querying/inserting into custom tables, confirm whether a column stores:
- Drupal `uid`
- a custom entity primary key
Do not assume `uid === <custom_id>`; verify schema before coding.

## Theme and Styling Standards

**CENTRALIZED STYLING MANDATE**: All styling must be managed through the theme's centralized CSS architecture:

- **NO INLINE CSS**: Inline `style=""` attributes are strictly prohibited in all templates and code
- **NO STYLE TAGS**: Embedded `<style>` tags are not allowed - all CSS must be in theme files
- **Standardized Theme**: Each site has a consistent look and feel maintained through its custom theme
- **CSS Organization**: All styling must be placed in appropriate theme CSS files:
  - Component-specific styles: `/themes/custom/{themename}/src/scss/components/_component-name.scss`
  - Base styles: `/themes/custom/{themename}/src/scss/base/`
  - Layout styles: `/themes/custom/{themename}/src/scss/layout/`
- **SCSS Compilation**: Theme uses SASS/SCSS compiled to CSS via build process
- **Library Declarations**: Attach CSS files through Drupal's library system in `*.libraries.yml`
- **Consistent Design System**: Maintain theme consistency across all pages and components
- **Build Process**: Run theme build process (`npm run dev` or `npm run production`) after CSS changes

**Theme Architecture Pattern**:
```
themes/custom/{themename}/
├── src/
│   ├── scss/
│   │   ├── main.style.scss          # Master import file
│   │   ├── base/                    # Base element styles
│   │   ├── components/              # Component-specific styles
│   │   └── layout/                  # Layout and structural styles
│   └── js/
├── build/
│   └── css/
│       └── main.style.css           # Compiled output
├── templates/                        # Twig templates (NO inline styles)
├── {themename}.libraries.yml        # Library definitions
└── package.json                      # Build configuration
```

**Enforcement**:
- **Code Review**: All inline styles will be rejected in code review
- **Template Purity**: Twig templates must focus on structure and content, not styling
- **Maintainability**: Centralized CSS ensures consistent updates and easier maintenance
- **Performance**: Proper caching and minification of compiled CSS files

- Fields: `field_descriptive_name` (snake_case)
- Classes: PascalCase following PSR-4
- Routes: `modulename.route_name`
- Permissions: `access module_name feature`

## Code Organization
- Place business logic in module files, not controllers
- Use controllers only for request/response handling
- Implement helper functions for complex data processing
- Separate public and admin functionality clearly
- Document all custom functions with proper docblocks

## Error Handling & Logging
- Use Drupal's logging system: `\Drupal::logger('module_name')`
- Log important operations (AI processing, data updates)
- Handle exceptions gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Provide debug information for troubleshooting
- Use appropriate log levels (info, warning, error)

## Business Integration Best Practices
- **Contact Forms**: Lead capture and client communication
- **Service Listings**: Professional service presentation
- Implement proper form validation and submission handling
- Handle client inquiries and business communications
- Provide clear service descriptions and business information
- Ensure mobile-responsive design for all business content

## Professional Website Requirements

## Testing & Debugging

### General Testing Standards
- Test with various content types and forms
- Verify mobile responsiveness across devices
- Test contact forms and lead generation functionality
- Use Drush commands for debugging and maintenance
- Implement proper error reporting for failed operations

### Automated JavaScript Console Testing (Playwright)

**Purpose**: Automatically detect JavaScript console errors without manual browser inspection. Essential for catching syntax errors, runtime exceptions, and network failures in complex pages like hexmap.

**Installation**:
```bash
# One-time setup in workspace root
npm install --save-dev playwright
```

**Playwright Testing Scripts** (Located in `/testing/playwright/`):

1. **capture-console.js** - Capture all browser console output
   - **Usage**: `node capture-console.js <url> [timeout] [output-file]`
   - **Example**: `node testing/playwright/capture-console.js http://localhost:8080/game 10000`
   - **Outputs**:
     - Real-time to stdout (formatted with timestamps and severity levels)
     - Optional JSON file with full details
   - **Captures**: console.log/error/warning/info/debug, network errors, page errors

2. **test-hexmap.js** - Automated hexmap console error detection
   - **Usage**: `node test-hexmap.js [base-url] [timeout]`
   - **Example**: `node testing/playwright/test-hexmap.js http://localhost:8080`
   - **Exit Codes** (for CI/CD):
     - `0` = No errors found (PASS)
     - `1` = Console errors detected or test failed (FAIL)
   - **Fails If**: Any console errors, page crashes, or load failures detected

**Development Workflow**:

```bash
# Before committing JavaScript changes:
node testing/playwright/test-hexmap.js http://localhost:8080

# If errors found, run detailed capture:
node testing/playwright/capture-console.js http://localhost:8080/game 10000

# Fix errors in hexmap.js, then verify:
node --check sites/forseti/modules/custom/dungeoncrawler_content/assets/hexmap.js
node testing/playwright/test-hexmap.js http://localhost:8080
```

**CI/CD Integration**:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Test JavaScript Console
  run: |
    npm install --save-dev playwright
    node testing/playwright/test-hexmap.js http://localhost:8080
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Console errors detected - build failed"
      exit 1
    fi
```

**Common Error Patterns**:
- **Syntax Errors**: `Uncaught SyntaxError` - Fix with `node --check <file.js>`
- **Missing Methods**: `TypeError: xxx is not a function` - Verify method definitions
- **Network Failures**: `Failed to fetch` - Check API endpoints and CORS
- **Type Errors**: `Cannot read property 'x' of undefined` - Check initialization order

**When to Use**:
- After any JavaScript modifications
- Before creating pull requests
- In pre-commit hooks
- As part of CI/CD pipeline
- When debugging complex interactive features (hexmap, character sheet, etc.)

**Key Files for JavaScript Testing**:
- Main game code: `sites/forseti/modules/custom/dungeoncrawler_content/assets/hexmap.js` (4218 lines)
- Test scripts: `/testing/playwright/capture-console.js`, `/testing/playwright/test-hexmap.js`
- Documentation: `/testing/playwright/README.md`

**Troubleshooting**:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Playwright not installed | Run `npm install --save-dev playwright` from workspace root |
| Script not executable | Run `chmod +x testing/playwright/*.js` |
| Timeout errors | Increase timeout: `node capture-console.js http://localhost:8080 20000` |
| Connection refused | Ensure Apache is running: `sudo systemctl start apache2` |
| CORS/network errors | Check API endpoints are accessible from browser |
| No output | Add debug: `node capture-console.js <url> <timeout> output.json` then check JSON file |

**Post-JavaScript-Edit Checklist**:
1. ✅ Run Playwright test before committing
2. ✅ Verify exit code 0 (no errors)
3. ✅ If errors found, run capture for details
4. ✅ Fix syntax/errors locally
5. ✅ Re-run test to confirm fix
6. ✅ Commit with confidence

- ✅ **androidXCoreVersion**: 1.13.1 (avoids AGP 8.6+ requirement)

### **Version Compatibility Resolution**
Resolved complex version incompatibilities between React Native 0.72 and Android build tools:

**Critical Constraints**:
- React Native 0.72 Gradle plugin compiled with Kotlin 1.7.x
- AGP 8.6+ requires androidx.core 1.16.0+ which needs compileSdk 35
- Gradle 8.3+ includes Kotlin stdlib 1.9.x (incompatible with React Native plugin)
- AGP version must be compatible with both Gradle version and compileSdk level

**Solution Configuration** (verified working):
- **AGP 8.0.2**: Last stable version compatible with Kotlin 1.8.x and compileSdk 35
- **Gradle 8.0.1**: Compatible with AGP 8.0.2 and includes Kotlin stdlib ≤1.8.x

- ✅ **postinstall-postinstall**: Ensures patches applied after npm install
- ✅ **Patch Files**: 7 patch files created in `/patches/` directory
- ✅ **Automated Application**: postinstall script in package.json applies patches automatically

### **Development Workflow Best Practices**
**Namespace Requirements (AGP 8+)**:
- All React Native libraries must declare namespace in build.gradle
- Some libraries also require `buildFeatures { buildConfig true }`
- Use patch-package to persist fixes across npm installs
- Never modify node_modules directly without creating patches

**Version Compatibility Testing**:
- Test AGP and Gradle version combinations thoroughly
- Check Kotlin stdlib version compatibility with React Native plugins
- Verify androidx library version requirements against AGP minimums
- Document all version constraints in setup scripts

**Build Environment Setup**:
- Use automated setup script: `/script/setup-forseti-mobile-dev.sh`
- Script handles Java installation, Android SDK setup, and all compatibility fixes
- All fixes documented and reproducible for clean environment setup

### **Android Build Commands**
**Development Build** (Debug APK):
```bash
cd /home/keithaumiller/forseti.life/forseti-mobile/android
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
