## Overview
A comprehensive AI-powered Drupal module that automates the entire job application process using Generative AI. This system analyzes user resumes, scrapes job postings from employer websites, tailors applications using AI, and automatically submits applications across multiple employer platforms.

## Maintenance Notes
- 2026-04-13: Realigned the contact tracker with the current feature brief by adding `name`, `title`, and `company_id` compatibility to `jobhunter_contacts`, switching the UI to company-backed contacts, and matching saved-job contact surfacing on `company_id` before legacy-name fallback.
- 2026-03-02: Standardized GenAI fallback decisions into `GenAiFallbackService` for reusable process-flow gating (deterministic checks first, shared JSON contract, shared parsing). Initial production use is in Step 2 application-location verification.
- 2026-02-19: Auto-generate cover letter templates on profile load when missing, removing the manual generate button.
- 2026-02-19: Unified profile form resume parsing with ResumeGenAiParsingWorker chunked parsing to ensure a single shared GenAI flow and avoid token limits.
- 2026-02-19: Aligned error queue admin routes with the standard admin permission and added paging plus safe message previews to the error list.
- 2026-02-19: Split resume parsing into core and professional experience passes with adaptive chunk splitting to avoid token limits.
- 2026-02-17: Refactored `JobDiscoveryService` end-to-end for schema safety and consistency: centralized logger access, added shared company-field resolver (`name` vs `company_name`), and applied that resolver to saved-job list filtering/sorting and company dropdown queries.
- 2026-02-17: Unified search auto-imports external API results into `jobhunter_job_requirements`, but now skips duplicates using identifier checks (`job_hash`, then `external_source + external_job_id`, then `external_source + job_url`).
- 2026-02-17: Prevented duplicate "Forseti Jobs (Pending)" cards by deduplicating staging rows in `SearchAggregatorService::searchForsetiDatabase()` and by only caching true external API sources (`Google Jobs`, `Adzuna`, `USAJobs`, `Google Jobs (SerpAPI)`) in `storeSearchResults()`.
- 2026-02-17: Fixed `job-search-results.html.twig` to avoid direct Twig `csrf_token()` calls; token is now generated in `JobApplicationController::jobDiscoverySearchResults()` and passed as `save_job_csrf_token` to prevent Twig syntax errors while preserving AJAX save security.
- 2026-02-13: Controllers must not redeclare typed properties that exist on ControllerBase (e.g., entityTypeManager) to avoid PHP fatal errors in Drupal 11.
- 2026-02-17: Added per-job "Have applied" tracking on `/jobhunter/my-jobs` with toggle + applied date persistence (`jobhunter_job_requirements.applied_on_date`).
- 2026-02-17: Added schema-safe truncation for imported external metadata (`external_job_id`, URLs, `via`, and related varchar fields) in both immediate and cron import paths to prevent DB length errors.
- 2026-02-17: Job Search Results "Save Job" now uses AJAX and returns JSON on XHR requests so saves do not navigate away from `/jobhunter/job-discovery/search`.
- 2026-02-17: "Save Job" now supports fallback lookup by `external_job_id` in `jobhunter_job_search_results.job_data_json` when legacy/base64 payload decoding fails, preserving searched job data recovery.
- 2026-02-17: `My Jobs` now uses `jobhunter_saved_jobs` (uid↔job_id mapping) so the Forseti jobs catalog (`jobhunter_job_requirements`) stays global while saved jobs remain user-specific.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Read Architecture First
**Before any development work begins, all developers MUST read and understand the complete [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) document.** This system involves complex AI integration, automated web scraping, credential management, and multi-platform submission automation that requires thorough understanding of the architecture before implementation.

## 🛡️ IMPORTANT: Data Preservation Policy

**This module is designed to NEVER delete user content or fields during uninstallation.**

All job applications, company data, user profiles, resume files, and custom content are preserved to prevent accidental data loss.

### Protected During Uninstall
- **Content Types**: company, job_posting, application, issue, tailored_resume (and all their content)
- **User Fields**: field_resume_file, field_primary_resume_text, field_profile_completeness, etc.
- **Profile Fields**: field_profile_completeness, field_resume_file (job_seeker profile)
- **Views**: Job Applications Dashboard, Company Management, Job Discovery
- **All User Data**: Resume uploads, extracted text, profile information, application history

### What Gets Removed
Only module configuration settings (`job_hunter.settings`) are removed during uninstall.

### Manual Cleanup (Optional)
To remove content types/fields after uninstall: Structure > Content types > Delete or Configuration > Account settings > Manage fields > Delete

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. **Set Original Resume Node** - Navigate to `/jobhunter/settings` (Admin > Job Hunter > Settings)
2. **Select Resume Node** - Use autocomplete to select your master resume node
3. **Enable Automatic Tailoring** - Check the box to enable automatic resume generation when job postings are created
4. **Configure AI Settings** (optional) - AWS Bedrock region, model ID, and max tokens are preset but customizable
5. **Configure External Job APIs** - Add API credentials for job search aggregators:
   - **SerpAPI** - Google Jobs scraper (100 free searches/month) - [Get API key](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up)
   - **Google Cloud Talent Solution** - Add service account JSON key
   - **Adzuna API** - Job search API (App ID + Key required)
   - **USAJobs API** - US Government jobs (API Key + Email required)

The module uses AWS Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet by default. Ensure your environment has proper AWS credentials configured.

### Original Resume Selection

The module requires a designated "Original Resume" node to generate tailored versions. Configure this at `/jobhunter/settings`:

- **Configuration-based (Recommended)**: Admin selects the resume node via entity autocomplete in settings form
- **Fallback (Legacy)**: System searches for a resume node titled "Original Resume" if not configured
- **Warning Logging**: If no resume is found, warnings are logged to help with troubleshooting

## Current Working System **[✅ IMPLEMENTED]**

### **Resume Management & JSON Storage Workflow** **[✅ IMPLEMENTED]**

The module provides a streamlined 4-step workflow focused on JSON storage of resume data:

#### **Step 1: File Upload** **[✅ WORKING]**
- User uploads .docx resume files to `private://job_hunter/resumes/`
- System automatically registers files in `jobhunter_job_seeker_resumes` table
- File entities created automatically for each uploaded resume
- Status checklist initialized: ⬜ Text Extracted | ⬜ Individual JSON Stored | ⬜ Merged to Consolidated

#### **Step 2: Extract Text** **[✅ WORKING]**
- **Button Location**: Inline next to "Text Extracted" status line
- **Action**: Click "Extract Text" button to extract content from .docx file
- **Processing**: Uses `PhpOffice\PhpWord` to parse document structure
- **Storage**: Stores extracted text in `jobhunter_job_seeker_resumes.extracted_text` LONGTEXT field
- **Status Update**: ✅ Text Extracted (X chars) | ⬜ Individual JSON Stored | ⬜ Merged to Consolidated
- **Character Tracking**: Displays character count for verification (e.g., "22,987 chars")

#### **Step 3: Parse JSON** **[✅ WORKING]**
- **Button Location**: Inline next to "Individual JSON Stored" status line
- **Prerequisites**: Text must be extracted first
- **AI Processing**: Calls AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to analyze resume structure
- **Fallback**: Mock data if AWS credentials not configured or timeout occurs
- **JSON Schema**: Structured data with arrays for job_history and education_history
- **Storage**: Stores parsed JSON in `jobhunter_resume_parsed_data.parsed_data` JSON field
- **Status Update**: ✅ Text Extracted | ✅ Individual JSON Stored | ⬜ Merged to Consolidated

**Response Normalization**: The parser now normalizes AI responses that return JSON as a
string-escaped payload (e.g., literal `\n` sequences between lines). This ensures valid
JSON is decoded even when the model returns escaped formatting.

**Individual Resume JSON Structure**:
```json
{
  "professional_summary": "string",
  "skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"],
  "experience_years": 15,
  "education_level": "Bachelor's",
  "certifications": ["cert1", "cert2"],
  "job_titles": ["title1", "title2"],
  "job_history": [
    {
      "company": "Company Name",
      "title": "Job Title",
      "start_date": "2020-01",
      "end_date": "2023-12",
      "description": "Roles and responsibilities..."
    }
  ],
  "education_history": [
    {
      "institution": "University Name",
      "degree": "Bachelor of Science",
      "field": "Computer Science",
      "graduation_date": "2010-05"
    }
  ],
  "contact_info": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "phone": "555-1234",
    "location": "City, State"
  }
}
```

#### **Step 4: Consolidate** **[✅ WORKING]**
- **Button Location**: Inline next to "Merged to Consolidated" status line
- **Prerequisites**: Individual JSON must exist for the resume
- **Deduplication Logic**: Smart merging of data from multiple resumes
  - Skills: Unique values only, comma-separated parsing
  - Professional Summary: Array of unique summaries from all resumes
  - Experience Years: Maximum value across all resumes
  - Education Level: Highest level across all resumes
  - Job History: Deduplicated by company + title + dates, tracks source resumes
  - Education History: Deduplicated by institution + degree, tracks source resumes
- **Storage**: Updates `jobhunter_job_seeker.consolidated_profile_json` JSON field
- **Status Update**: ✅ Text Extracted | ✅ Individual JSON Stored | ✅ Merged to Consolidated

**Profile Pre-Fill**: `/jobhunter/profile/edit` reads `consolidated_profile_json` to
pre-populate contact and summary fields when available.

**Search Assist Section**: Job search preferences and demographic fields are shown
at the top of the profile form under “Fill this out to assist in your search.” These
fields are user-entered and are not derived from the resume JSON.

**Salary Fields**: Salary inputs no longer render a `$` suffix in the UI. The section
now includes a single note indicating all salary values are in USD.

**Consolidated Profile JSON Structure**:
```json
{
  "professional_summary": ["summary from resume 1", "summary from resume 2"],
  "skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3", "skill4"],
  "experience_years": 15,
  "education_level": "Master's",
  "certifications": ["cert1", "cert2", "cert3"],
  "job_titles": ["title1", "title2", "title3"],
  "job_history": [
    {
      "company": "Company A",
      "title": "Senior Engineer",
      "start_date": "2020-01",
      "end_date": "2023-12",
      "description": "Combined roles...",
      "source_resumes": [20, 21]
    }
  ],
  "education_history": [
    {
      "institution": "University",
      "degree": "Master's",
      "field": "CS",
      "graduation_date": "2015-05",
      "source_resumes": [20]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Current Scope: JSON + Projections** **[🎯 FOCUSED]**

The workflow uses a hybrid approach:
1. **AI Artifacts (JSON)**
   - **Individual Resume Data**: `jobhunter_resume_parsed_data.parsed_data` (per resume file)
   - **Consolidated Profile Data**: `jobhunter_job_seeker.consolidated_profile_json` (merged from all resumes)
2. **Query-Friendly Projections (Columns)**
   - A small set of commonly-filtered fields are written into dedicated columns on
     `jobhunter_job_seeker` (e.g., location, remote preference, salary range, key URLs).
   - These projection columns are **derived** from `consolidated_profile_json` and can be
     rebuilt at any time; they exist to support fast filtering/sorting and workflow checks
     without requiring JSON parsing.

**Features Deferred (Commented Out)**:
- ❌ Profile text field population (professional_summary, skills, certifications columns)
- ❌ Job history relational table inserts (`jobhunter_job_history` table unused)
- ❌ Education history relational table inserts (`jobhunter_education_history` table unused)

These features exist in the codebase but are commented out per development priorities. Future implementation may populate relational tables and/or Drupal fields from the consolidated JSON data.

### Resume Tailoring Process Flow **[✅ IMPLEMENTED]**

The resume tailoring page (`/jobhunter/tailor-resume/{job_id}`) provides a comprehensive workflow for tailoring resumes to specific job postings.

#### Status Lifecycle

| Status | Database Value | UI Label | Description |
|--------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Pending** | `pending` (or no record) | "Ready to Tailor" | Initial state - user hasn't requested tailoring |
| **Queued** | `queued` | "In Queue" | Request submitted, waiting for queue worker |
| **Processing** | `processing` | "Tailoring in Progress" | AI is generating tailored resume (30-60 sec) |
| **Completed** | `completed` | "Tailored & Ready" | Resume ready for review and PDF generation |
| **Failed** | `failed` | "Tailoring Failed" | Error occurred, retry available |

#### Status Determination Logic

```
Page Load → Query jobhunter_tailored_resumes for (uid, job_id)
         ↓
    Record exists?
         ↓
    NO → status = 'pending'
    YES → status = record.tailoring_status
```

#### Skills Gap Analysis

The page automatically calculates which job-required skills are missing from the user's profile:

**Data Sources:**
- Job skills from `jobhunter_job_requirements.skills_required_json` (must_have, nice_to_have, tech_stack)
- User skills from `jobhunter_job_seeker.consolidated_profile_json` (technical_expertise, skills, certifications)

**Matching Logic:**
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Fuzzy matching (substring containment both directions)
- Results split into "Must Have (Missing)" and "Nice to Have (Missing)"

#### Add Skill to Profile Feature

Users can add missing skills directly from the tailoring page:
- **Individual:** Click "+ Add to Profile" on any missing skill
- **Bulk:** "Add All Must-Have Skills" or "Add All Missing Skills" buttons
- **Storage:** Skills added to `consolidated_profile_json.technical_expertise`
- **Default Proficiency:** 'intermediate'
- **Refresh:** Click "🔄 Refresh Skills Gap" after adding to re-calculate

    status = 'completed'              status = 'failed'
    Store tailored_resume_json        Log error
```

#### Database Tables

**Storage Strategy:** This module uses a hybrid model — **nodes for canonical content** and **custom tables for operational/automation data** (AI artifacts, pipeline state, sync metadata). See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for policy and rules.

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `jobhunter_job_requirements` | Job posting data (extracted_json, skills_required_json) |

### User Profile Forms **[✅ IMPLEMENTED]**

The User Profile Forms feature provides a comprehensive profile management system that allows users to maintain job search information required for job matching and application automation.

#### Profile Completeness System

Users are assigned a profile completeness percentage (0-100%) calculated from two categories:

**Required Fields (70% weight):**
- 📄 Resume file (`field_resume`)
- 🛂 Work authorization status (`field_work_authorization`)
- 📅 Available start date (`field_available_start_date`)
- 🏠 Remote work preference (`field_remote_preference`)

**Optional Fields (30% weight):**
- Professional summary
- Key skills
- Professional keywords
- Salary expectations
- Target companies

**Calculation Logic:**
```
Required Completeness = (Filled Required Fields / 4) × 70%
Optional Completeness = (Filled Optional Fields / 5) × 30%
Total Profile % = Required Completeness + Optional Completeness
```

#### Access Points

| Path | Purpose | Access |
|------|---------|--------|
| `/jobhunter/profile/summary` | Profile dashboard with completeness indicator | Authenticated users |
| `/user/{uid}/edit` | Edit profile with organized fieldsets | User or admin |
| `/user/register` | Registration form with job search section | Anonymous (registration enabled) |

#### Profile Dashboard (`/jobhunter/profile/summary`)

The profile dashboard displays:

1. **Completeness Progress Bar**
   - Visual progress indicator showing 0-100%
   - Color-coded status (red: incomplete, yellow: nearly complete, green: complete)
   - Animated transitions on profile updates

2. **Validation Alerts** (if profile incomplete)
   - Lists all missing required fields with emoji icons
   - Provides specific guidance for each field
   - Includes links to edit form for quick completion

3. **Profile Summary Table**
   - All 9 tracked profile fields displayed
   - Current value or "Missing" badge
   - Completion indicator (✅ or 🔲)
   - Smart value display per field type:
     - Resume: Filename with file icon
     - Dates: Formatted (Month Day, Year)
     - Salary: Currency format with range
     - Remote/Authorization: Text display
     - Companies: Count with term naming

#### Form Organization

**User Registration Form** (`/user/register`)
- New section: "Job Search Profile" (fieldset)
- Displays 4 required fields with descriptions
- Minimizes overwhelm for new users
- Descriptions provide inline help text

**User Edit Form** (`/user/{uid}/edit`)
- New section: "Job Search Information" (collapsible)
- All 11 profile fields organized by category:
  - Basic Information (resume, authorization, dates)
  - Work Preferences (remote, relocation, travel requirements)
  - Professional Details (summary, skills, keywords)
  - Compensation (salary expectations)
  - Target Companies (company selection)
- Field descriptions from service provide guidance
- Organized tabs/fieldsets prevent cognitive overload

#### Service Architecture

**Service:** `UserJobProfileService` (`src/Service/UserJobProfileService.php`)

```php
// Get profile as percentage (0-100)
$completeness = $service->getProfileCompleteness($user);

// Check if profile meets minimum requirements
$is_complete = $service->isProfileComplete($user);

// Get validation errors for missing fields
$errors = $service->validateProfile($user);

// Get summary of all profile fields for display
$summary = $service->getProfileSummary($user);

// Get field descriptions for form labels
$descriptions = $service->getFieldDescriptions();

// Update completeness tracking fields
$service->updateProfileCompleteness($user);
```

#### CSS Styling

Profile display uses centralized CSS styling via the `job_hunter/user-profile-styling` library:

**Files:**
- `css/profile.css` - All profile-related styling

**Key Classes:**
- `.profile-completeness-container` - Dashboard container
- `.progress-bar` - Animated completeness progress bar
- `.validation-errors` - Missing field alerts with styling
- `.profile-summary-container` - Field summary table wrapper
- `.profile-fields-table` - Profile fields data table with responsive design
- `.badge-success` / `.badge-incomplete` - Field status badges

**Responsive Design:**
- Desktop: Full table layout with hover effects
- Tablet: Readable with adjusted padding
- Mobile: Card-based layout with data attributes

#### Testing

**Unit Tests:** `tests/src/Unit/Service/UserJobProfileServiceTest.php`
- Profile completeness calculation with various field combinations
- Validation error detection for required fields
- Completion status checks
- Profile summary generation
- Field descriptions retrieval

**Functional Tests:** `tests/src/Functional/UserProfileFormTest.php`
- Registration form includes job search fields
- Edit form requires job search section
- Profile completeness updates on save
- Validation errors display correctly
- Profile marked complete when required fields filled

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Run all job_hunter tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit modules/custom/job_hunter/tests

# Run only profile service tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit modules/custom/job_hunter/tests/src/Unit/Service/UserJobProfileServiceTest.php

# Run only profile form tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit modules/custom/job_hunter/tests/src/Functional/UserProfileFormTest.php
```

#### Hooks Implementation

**Form Alteration Hooks** (job_hunter.module):

1. `hook_form_user_register_form_alter()`
   - Adds job_search_profile fieldset with required fields
   - Sets field descriptions from service
   - Makes registration form collect essential profile info

2. `hook_form_user_form_alter()`
   - Reorganizes 11 profile fields into collapsible sections
   - Adds descriptions from service for guidance
   - Attaches submit handler for tracking

3. `job_hunter_user_form_submit()`
   - After form save, updates profile completeness tracking
   - Updates `field_profile_completeness` and `field_last_profile_update`
   - Displays success message with profile status

#### Controller Methods

**ProfileDashboard** (UserProfileController::profileDashboard())
- Loads current user profile
- Calls service methods to fetch metrics
- Renders profile-completeness and profile-summary templates
- Sets no-cache headers for real-time display
- Provides profile summary + validation errors + action buttons

#### Database Fields

**Core Profile Fields (User Entity):**
- `field_resume` - File field for resume upload
- `field_work_authorization` - Select list (US Citizen, Green Card, etc.)
- `field_available_start_date` - Date field
- `field_remote_preference` - Select (Remote Only, On-Site Only, Hybrid, Any)
- `field_professional_summary` - Long text field
- `field_key_skills` - Multi-value text field (skills list)
- `field_professional_keywords` - Text field
- `field_salary_expectation` - Entity reference range (min/max salary nodes)
- `field_target_companies` - Multi-select entity reference to company nodes

**Tracking Fields:**
- `field_profile_completeness` - Integer (0-100%)
- `field_last_profile_update` - Timestamp field
