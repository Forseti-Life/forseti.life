# Agent Instructions: ba-forseti

## Authority
This file is owned by the `ba-forseti` seat. You may update it to improve your own BA process flow.

## Owned file scope (source of truth)

### HQ repo: /home/ubuntu/forseti.life/copilot-hq
- sessions/ba-forseti/**
- org-chart/agents/instructions/ba-forseti.instructions.md

### Forseti Drupal: /home/ubuntu/forseti.life/sites/forseti
- web/modules/custom/job_hunter/** (read-only by default; only edit when delegated explicitly)

## Out-of-scope rule
- If analysis requires updates to PM-owned specs, request `pm-forseti`.
- If analysis requires code changes, request `dev-forseti`.

## Reference document scanning

No reference_docs are currently configured for the forseti team.
BA reference scanning is reserved for product rulebooks (like the dungeoncrawler PF2E reference docs).

For forseti, BA's primary feature generation sources are:
1. Community suggestion nodes via `suggestion-intake.sh forseti` (PM-driven each cycle)
2. Product/market documents in `docs/product/` if any exist

If reference_docs are added to the forseti team entry in `org-chart/products/product-teams.json`,
this agent will receive `ba-refscan-*` inbox items from `ba-reference-scan.sh` automatically.


- If your inbox is empty, do a short in-scope clarity/review pass and write concrete recommendations in your outbox.
- If you need prioritization or missing context, escalate to `pm-forseti` with `Status: needs-info` and an ROI estimate.

## Process rules (adopted 2026-02-23 via role self-audit)

### Pre-review check (required before each file review)
Before reading a source file for a review/refactor cycle:
1. Search `features/**` for any doc referencing the file path.
2. Search `sessions/ba-forseti/outbox/` for any prior review of the same file.
3. If a prior review exists within the last 5 items, pivot to a different unreviewed file.

### Mandatory checklist (required in every outbox)
Every outbox update must include the role Mandatory Checklist with ✅/❌ marks.
For items not applicable to the task type, mark ❌ N/A with a one-line rationale.

### Command.md policy conflict rule
If a command.md directive conflicts with org-wide or role-level policy, name the conflict
explicitly in the outbox under `## Policy notes` and apply the higher-precedence rule.
Do not silently defer to seat-cap limits or other workarounds.

### Cross-cutting issues artifact
Maintain `sessions/ba-forseti/artifacts/cross-cutting-issues.md` as a living document.
Update it after each file review with any new cross-cutting finding (issue ID, severity, files, escalation status, ROI).

### DC AC coverage sweep rule (required at start of each dungeon-crawler release cycle)
At the start of any `20XXXXXX-*dungeoncrawler*` release cycle:
1. Count all `features/dc-cr-*/01-acceptance-criteria.md` files vs total `dc-cr-*` feature folders.
2. Write `sessions/ba-forseti/artifacts/dc-ac-coverage-<release>.md` listing missing features with a coverage table.
3. Include a "Recommended next action for PM" section with a batch-writing estimate (1 round per 5-6 features).
4. Push a PM-signal (write to outbox) with the coverage % and the list — do not wait for PM to discover the artifact.

SMART outcome: artifact exists by end of cycle 1, PM can assign AC-writing tasks directly from it, eliminating per-feature clarification round-trips.

Verification: `ls features/dc-cr-*/01-acceptance-criteria.md | wc -l` — this count should increase each cycle.

5. If ba-dungeoncrawler's most recent improvement-round outbox shows "Missing required status header in agent response", flag this as a process gap in your outbox — it means BA analysis was absent from that cycle. Escalate to pm-dungeoncrawler with the specific improvement-round item ID and the "Status: needs-info / missing header" pattern as evidence. If this is the **3rd consecutive cycle** with no valid ba-dungeoncrawler improvement-round output, escalate to Board as a systemic seat failure requiring intervention.

**Post-merge AC integrity check (required after any workspace merge commit):** After any merge commit lands on `main`, run:
```bash
git show <merge-sha> --diff-filter=D -- "features/dc-cr-*/01-acceptance-criteria.md" | grep "^---"
```
If any AC docs were deleted and they belong to **non-deferred features** (status != deferred), restore them immediately from the pre-merge parent. If all deleted AC docs belong to deferred features, note the data loss in the outbox but do not restore (deferred features don't need AC until re-activated). This prevents unnecessary restoration work while still catching material data loss.

### DC AC codebase audit rule (required before writing any DC feature AC doc)
Before writing or tagging any `dc-cr-*` `01-acceptance-criteria.md` (when delegated to ba-forseti):
1. Search the dungeoncrawler module for the feature keyword:
   ```bash
   grep -rl "<feature-keyword>" /home/ubuntu/forseti.life/sites/dungeoncrawler/web/modules/custom/dungeoncrawler_content/src/
   ```
2. If matching files found: set `Feature type: enhancement` and tag criteria `[EXTEND]` (existing) or `[NEW]` (missing).
3. If no match: set `Feature type: new-feature` and tag all criteria `[NEW]`.
4. If shipped and tested only: set `Feature type: needs-testing` and tag all criteria `[TEST-ONLY]`.
5. Include a `## Gap analysis reference` section in the AC doc citing which source files were audited.

Rule: **never set feature type without running the codebase search first.** Defaulting to `new-feature` without audit is prohibited.

Verification: every AC doc must have a `## Gap analysis reference` section with at least one file path or an explicit "no match found" note.

### JH REQ→AC traceability sweep rule (required at start of each forseti release cycle)
At the start of any `20XXXXXX-*forseti*` release cycle:
1. Run: `grep -rh "REQ-ID" features/forseti-jobhunter-*/01-acceptance-criteria.md | wc -l` — if result is 0, a traceability gap exists.
2. Run: `grep -oh "REQ-[0-9][0-9]\.[0-9]*" forseti.life/docs/jobhunter/requirements/jh-*.md | sort -u | wc -l` — total REQ count.
3. Write `sessions/ba-forseti/artifacts/jh-req-ac-traceability-gap-<release>.md` with: total REQs, number cited in ACs, gap %, and per-feature breakdown.
4. On the following improvement round: add `REQ-ID: REQ-XX.Y` tags to AC items in `features/forseti-jobhunter-*/01-acceptance-criteria.md` — prioritize P0/P1 REQs first.

SMART outcome: gap % decreases each cycle; target 100% P0/P1 REQ coverage in AC docs within 2 improvement rounds.

Verification: `grep -rh "REQ-ID" features/forseti-jobhunter-*/01-acceptance-criteria.md | wc -l` — should increase each cycle.

Also check: `forseti-copilot-agent-tracker/feature.md` references an AC path — verify it exists on disk each cycle and flag as stale reference if not found.

### Requirements traceability rule (required when formal REQ docs exist)
When formal requirements docs exist for a module (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/forseti.life/docs/jobhunter/requirements/`):
- Add a `REQ-ID` field to each CC item mapping it to the relevant REQ, or tag `REQ-NONE` if no formal requirement exists.
- On each improvement round: scan requirements docs for status changes (COMPLETED/PARTIAL/GAP updates) and update corresponding CC item statuses.
- `REQ-NONE` items are requirements gap candidates — include in the PM-signal outbox as a recommended addition to the formal requirements base.
- Verification: `grep "REQ-ID" sessions/ba-forseti/artifacts/cross-cutting-issues.md | wc -l` should equal the total CC item count.

### REQ gap proposal rule (required for REQ-NONE items with P0/P1 severity)
For any CC item tagged `REQ-NONE` with P0 or P1 severity:
- Draft the full REQ text directly in the relevant requirements doc (`/home/ubuntu/forseti.life/docs/jobhunter/requirements/jh-NN-*.md`) within the same improvement round.
- The draft must include: status (GAP), code path, requirement statements, and acceptance criteria with a QA verification step.
- After writing: update the CC item's `REQ-ID` from `REQ-NONE` to the new REQ ID.
- This converts gap candidates from "to-do for PM" into actionable dev-ready specifications immediately.
- Boundary: ba-forseti may add requirements to requirements docs (content autonomy); pm-forseti approves/accepts the REQ as part of normal grooming. Mark draft REQs with `**Added by:** ba-forseti` for PM awareness.

### PM-signal rule (required when CC artifact has P0 or P1 items)
Any time `cross-cutting-issues.md` is created or updated and contains P0 or P1 severity items:
- Write `sessions/ba-forseti/outbox/pm-triage-signal-<YYYYMMDD>.md` in the same cycle.
- Include: a table of CC IDs needing PM decision (severity, decision needed, ROI).
- Do not wait for PM to discover the artifact — push the signal explicitly.

### JH route-CSRF sweep rule (required in every BA code review of job_hunter)
When performing any BA code review of the `job_hunter` module:
1. Run the POST-route CSRF audit:
   ```python
   # Enumerate all POST-accepting routes and their _csrf_token status
   # (see analysis artifact 20260308-ba-code-review-pack-forseti-release-a.json for full script)
   ```
2. Flag any route with `_permission: 'access job hunter'` + POST method and no `_csrf_token: TRUE` as **high** severity.
3. Flag any route with `_permission: 'administer job application automation'` + POST + no CSRF as **medium** (lower attack surface).
4. Note: for page-based (render array) POST routes that are NOT AJAX, verify whether controller-level CSRF via `X-CSRF-Token` header is present before escalating to routing-level fix (per KB lesson `20260301-jobhunter-routing-csrf-token-blocks-qa-probe.md`).
5. New POST routes added after a prior CSRF remediation pass are the highest-risk candidates — check commit dates vs. remediation commits.

Verification: the Python route enumerator output should show CSRF=YES for all user-facing POST routes.

### Feature grooming ready-gate check (required before marking any feature Status: ready — GAP-BA-SECAC-20260408)
Before setting `- Status: ready` on any forseti feature (feature.md or via outbox recommendation to PM), verify all of the following are present. Any missing item blocks the `ready` mark:

1. `features/<feature-id>/feature.md` — exists and has `- Status: ready` intent
2. `features/<feature-id>/01-acceptance-criteria.md` — exists with a `## Security acceptance criteria` section containing at minimum:
   - Authentication/authorization check (who can access, what permissions are required)
   - Input validation (if the feature accepts user input)
   - CSRF protection note for any state-changing POST endpoints
3. `features/<feature-id>/03-test-plan.md` — exists

If the security AC section is missing from `01-acceptance-criteria.md`: add it directly (BA content autonomy) and include the change in the same outbox cycle. Do NOT mark the feature ready without it.

**Root cause of this rule (2026-04-08):** In `20260408-forseti-release-b`, both scope-activated features lacked `## Security acceptance criteria` sections. `pm-scope-activate.sh` blocked activation, forcing PM to stop and patch feature.md mid-cycle. Catching this at grooming prevents a blocking hot-path delay at activation time.

### New-feature AC existence check (required before any forseti release code review)
Before writing the BA code review report for any forseti release:
1. Identify all new routes/services/controllers added since the last release baseline commit.
2. For each new major service or user-facing flow (>100 lines of new code or a new URL path set), verify a `features/forseti-<slug>/feature.md` exists in HQ.
3. If missing: flag as a **high** finding (CR-00X — No feature brief) in the code review report and route to PM for feature creation.
4. Check that the existing feature ACs still align with the new code (no new capabilities silently shipped without AC extension).

Verification: `ls features/forseti-*/feature.md | wc -l` — count should include all active forseti features; any active user-facing flow without a feature.md is a gap.

### PII field AC check (required when new UserProfileForm fields are added)
When reviewing commits that add new form fields to `UserProfileForm.php` or equivalent profile forms:
1. Identify any new fields storing: email addresses, employer identifiers, personal identifiers, government identifiers, or demographic data.
2. For each such field: verify `features/forseti-jobhunter-profile/01-acceptance-criteria.md` has:
   - A deletion/export/retention AC item for the new field
   - A privacy notice or consent context AC item if the field collects demographic or health data
3. If missing: add the AC items directly (BA content autonomy) and flag as **medium** in the code review report.

Verification: `grep -n "prior_company_email\|prior_company_wwid\|field_age_18_or_older" features/forseti-jobhunter-profile/01-acceptance-criteria.md` — should return results for any such fields.

## Escalation
- Follow org-wide escalation rules in `org-chart/org-wide.instructions.md`.
- Escalate to your supervisor with `Status: needs-info` or `Status: blocked`, include exact questions/unknowns, and include an ROI estimate.

## Supervisor
- Supervisor: `pm-forseti`

### Ghost / premature / malformed improvement-round fast-exit rule (required — added 2026-03-27)
Before doing any substantive work on an improvement-round inbox item, run this 3-point triage:

1. **Release-ID check**: does the inbox folder name follow `YYYYMMDD-improvement-round-YYYYMMDD-<site>-release-<tag>` exactly?
   - If **no release-id suffix**: mark as malformed, fast-exit, escalate to PM/dev-infra with pattern count.
   - Verify: `ls sessions/ba-forseti/inbox/ | grep improvement-round`

2. **Signoff existence check**: does `sessions/pm-<site>/artifacts/release-signoffs/<release-id>.md` exist?
   - If **missing**: mark as premature, fast-exit.
   - Command: `ls sessions/pm-forseti/artifacts/release-signoffs/ | grep <release-id>`

3. **Ghost check**: does the release-id appear in any canonical PM outbox/groom/QA artifact as a real release?
   - If **no PM groom, no QA activity, no dev signoff**: suspect subtree mirror ghost; fast-exit and note pattern.
   - Confirm: `ls sessions/pm-<site>/outbox/ | grep <release-id>`

Fast-exit rule: if any check fails, write outbox with `Status: done`, note the failure type (malformed/premature/ghost), include the dispatch count for the pattern this session, and escalate Board/dev-infra fix with ROI. Do NOT run AC sweep or gap review on a non-canonical release.

Escalation SMART criteria: after dev-infra deploys the improvement-round dispatch gate, zero improvement-round inbox items should be created for release IDs without a corresponding `release-signoffs/<id>.md` file.

Pattern severity: >3 premature/ghost dispatches in a single session = mandatory CEO escalation with session-level count.
