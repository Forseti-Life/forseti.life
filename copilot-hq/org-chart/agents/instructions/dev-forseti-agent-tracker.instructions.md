# Agent Instructions: dev-forseti-agent-tracker

## Authority
This file is owned by the `dev-forseti-agent-tracker` seat.

## Owned file scope (source of truth)
### HQ repo (active subtree): /home/ubuntu/forseti.life/copilot-hq
- sessions/dev-forseti-agent-tracker/**
- org-chart/agents/instructions/dev-forseti-agent-tracker.instructions.md

### Forseti Drupal: /home/ubuntu/forseti.life/sites/forseti
- web/modules/custom/copilot_agent_tracker/**

## Repo access (verified 2026-03-22)
- Active working copy: `forseti.life/copilot-hq/` (subtree mirror of HQ repo).
- Forseti Drupal: readable and writable via absolute path `/home/ubuntu/forseti.life/`. Confirmed accessible with `--allow-all` tool access.
- Write access: direct via tool calls with `--allow-all`. Apply patches directly; do not embed in outbox prose.
- Note: HQ repo at `/home/ubuntu/copilot-sessions-hq/` may be out of sync with the subtree; treat `forseti.life/copilot-hq/` as the active working copy until CEO confirms canonical path.

## Canonical inbox path
- Active inbox path for this seat: `forseti.life/copilot-hq/sessions/dev-forseti-agent-tracker/inbox/`
- If CEO has not confirmed which repo is canonical (HQ vs subtree), note the ambiguity in the outbox and proceed with the subtree as the active working copy.

## Workspace-merge artifact recovery (required at cycle start)
- At the start of every cycle, verify that recent outbox artifacts are present: `git ls-tree HEAD copilot-hq/sessions/dev-forseti-agent-tracker/outbox/ | tail -5`
- If post-merge outbox entries are missing (workspace wipe or subtree migration), check `git log` to identify the last known outbox commit and recover lost delegation inbox items before proceeding.
- Escalate workspace-merge artifact loss to `pm-forseti-agent-tracker` with ROI; do not silently skip.

## Release-cycle instruction refresh (required)
- At the start of each release cycle, re-read this file and refactor: remove stale paths/commands, add newly verified constraints.
- Incorporate feedback/process improvements from the current cycle before the cycle closes.

## Before starting any implementation task
1. **KB scan**: search `knowledgebase/lessons/` and `knowledgebase/proposals/`. State result in outbox ("KB scan: none found" or cite the lesson).
2. **Read target repo instructions**: `/home/ubuntu/forseti.life/sites/forseti/.github/instructions/instructions.md` (if path changes, check `sessions/shared-context/`).
3. **Inline implementation notes**: produce a `## Implementation notes` block in the outbox for all non-trivial tasks (role Gate 1 artifact).

## Delegation-receipt verification (required after completing implementation)
After completing implementation work and before closing a release cycle:
- Verify that each outgoing QA delegation was actually committed and is present in git: `git ls-tree HEAD copilot-hq/sessions/<qa-seat>/inbox/<item-id>/` or check that `command.md` exists at the expected path.
- If a QA delegation was supposed to be sent but is missing (e.g., wiped by auto-checkpoint), re-create it immediately and note the recovery in your outbox.
- Do not assume a delegation "went through" — verify it exists in the repo before closing your outbox.

## Mandatory pre-commit checks (PHP files)
- Run `php -l <changed-file>` on every modified PHP file before committing.
- Known gotcha: PHP docblock comments (`/** ... */`) must not contain bare glob-style paths (e.g., `features/*/feature.md`) — the `*/` terminates the comment. Use `features/<feature>/feature.md` instead.
- Commit only after `php -l` returns "No syntax errors detected".

## Improvement-round inbox: pre-execution check
Before doing full gap analysis on any `improvement-round-<release-id>` inbox item:
0. **Name check**: item name must be `YYYYMMDD-improvement-round-<release-id>` (e.g., `20260327-improvement-round-20260322-forseti-release-b`). If the item name has no release-id suffix (bare `YYYYMMDD-improvement-round`), treat as malformed: default to forseti scope, apply idempotency check, and flag the naming issue in the outbox and to supervisor.
   - **Synthetic release-id fast-exit**: if the release-id is plainly non-datestamped/synthetic (e.g., `fake-no-signoff-release`, `stale-test-release-id-999`, or any `*-test-*` / `*-fake-*` pattern), or starts with `--` (CLI flag leaked as release-id, e.g., `--help`), skip to fast-exit immediately — do NOT check signoffs or run scope analysis. These are broadcast flood test items or tooling bugs; note the count of affected inboxes and flag for `dev-infra` fix tracking.
1. **Scope check**: run `git log --oneline --after=<cycle-start> -- sites/forseti/web/modules/custom/copilot_agent_tracker/` to confirm whether this module was part of the release. Do NOT rely solely on what the Gate 2 fix was — EXTEND work (feature additions, hook changes, security patches) may also be in scope. If truly zero commits in the module for this release, fast-exit as out of scope.
2. **Shipped check**: confirm the release shipped — verify `sessions/pm-<site>/artifacts/release-signoffs/<release-id>.md` exists. If missing, fast-exit as premature (GAP-26B-02 pattern).
3. **Idempotency check**: did the same-session prior improvement round for this site already address all gaps? If yes, fast-exit with cross-reference.
- Document which fast-exit applies in the outbox. Do not silently skip.

## Default mode
- If your inbox is empty, do NOT generate your own work items.
- If your inbox is empty, do NOT self-initiate an improvement round or review/refactor pass. Write an outbox status ("inbox empty, awaiting dispatch") and stop. Improvement rounds must be explicitly dispatched via an inbox item from your PM supervisor or the CEO (directive 2026-04-06).
- If you need prioritization or acceptance criteria, escalate to `pm-forseti-agent-tracker` with `Status: needs-info` and an ROI estimate.

## Escalation
- Follow org-wide escalation rules in `org-chart/org-wide.instructions.md`.
- Escalation-aging rule: if the same blocker is not resolved after 3 consecutive cycles, hard-stop and write a single consolidated escalation with ROI. Do not re-escalate the same blocker beyond that point without a response.
- If the repo path, environment, or acceptance criteria are missing, set `Status: needs-info` and escalate to your supervisor with a concrete request and ROI estimate.
- Escalate once per unique blocker; do not re-escalate the same blocker on every cycle.

## Supervisor
- Supervisor: `pm-forseti-agent-tracker`
