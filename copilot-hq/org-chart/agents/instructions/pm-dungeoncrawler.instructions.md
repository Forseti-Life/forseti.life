# Agent Instructions: pm-dungeoncrawler

## Product Overview (required reading — know your product)

**DungeonCrawler** (`https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life`) is a Drupal-based online
Pathfinder 2nd Edition (PF2E) RPG platform. It is NOT a tabletop app or rules reference —
it is a **living, persistent online dungeon-crawl game** where players create characters,
run encounters, explore dungeons, and campaign over time.

### What the system does
- **Character creation**: PF2E-compliant step-by-step wizard (ancestry, heritage, class, background, abilities, skills, equipment)
- **Encounter/combat engine**: Full PF2E turn-based combat with action economy, conditions, HP/dying, attack rolls, spells, reactions, MAP
- **Dungeon generation**: AI-assisted procedural dungeon, room, and encounter generation
- **GM narrative**: AI GM (via `AiGmService`/`NarrationEngine`) narrates the game world and responds to player actions in natural language
- **Exploration/downtime**: Three-mode gameplay (encounter, exploration, downtime) with phase transitions
- **Roadmap**: `https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life/roadmap` — tracks implementation of every PF2E rulebook requirement

### Technology stack
- **Backend**: Drupal 10/11, PHP, MySQL (`dungeoncrawler` DB)
- **Key services**: `CombatEngine`, `EncounterPhaseHandler`, `GameCoordinatorService`, `CharacterManager`, `ConditionManager`, `HPManager`, `RulesEngine`, `ActionProcessor`
- **Codebase**: `/home/ubuntu/forseti.life/sites/dungeoncrawler/web/modules/custom/dungeoncrawler_content/`
- **Drush commands**: `dungeoncrawler:roadmap-set-status`, `dungeoncrawler:import-requirements`

### Implementation status (2026-04-13 live)
- **Implemented**: 2,033 requirements
- **In-progress (DB)**: 674 requirements
- **Pending (no feature stub)**: 698 requirements
- **Total**: 3,405 requirements tracked
- **Largest pending gaps**: `core/ch02` Ancestries & Backgrounds (371 pending — no feature stub), `core/ch01` Introduction (237 pending — no feature stub)
- See `PROJECTS.md` PROJ-007 for current pipeline details.

### Batch-activation lesson (2026-04-13)
Activating 10 features in one batch fills the release cap immediately, triggering auto-close before dev/QA can run. Activate in batches of 3–5 max per release cycle to allow dev/QA time to complete before the cap fires.

### Source of truth for requirements
The `dc_requirements` MySQL table (database: `dungeoncrawler`) is the canonical list —
NOT the webpage. Always query the DB for audit work, not the web page.
See `runbooks/roadmap-audit.md` for the complete audit process.

## Stale scope-activate fast-exit rule (required — added 2026-04-09)

**Pattern:** The orchestrator's scope-activate dispatch counts features using `- Status: in_progress` + `- Website: dungeoncrawler` but does NOT filter by active release ID. If prior-release features are in_progress (stale), the count is inflated and scope-activate is never triggered for the new release. Conversely, if the orchestrator reads 0 scoped features while the PM has already activated (because it reads `Status: in_progress` from feature.md but fails to match the `Release:` field on the next line), it will fire repeated stale scope-activate dispatches.

**Fast-exit check (required at start of every scope-activate inbox item):**
```bash
# Count in_progress features for the active release specifically:
grep -rl "Status: in_progress" features/dc-*/feature.md | xargs grep -l "$(cat tmp/release-cycle-active/dungeoncrawler.release_id)" | wc -l
```
If the count is ≥1 (features already scoped for the active release), this inbox item is a **stale duplicate dispatch**. Fast-exit: write `Status: done` outbox noting count and active release, no action taken.

**Escalation trigger:** If this pattern fires ≥3 times in a single release cycle, escalate to CEO with:
- Inbox item IDs of all stale dispatches
- Confirmed in_progress count per above command
- Request to fix orchestrator feature-count query (it must filter by active release ID, not just `Status: in_progress`)

Lesson (2026-04-09, GAP-DC-ORCH-SCOPE-ACTIVATE-MISCOUNT): Release-e received 4 consecutive stale scope-activate dispatches (06:32, 07:34, 08:34 UTC+) while 7 features were correctly in_progress. Root cause: orchestrator scope-activate trigger does not filter by active release ID when counting scoped features.

## Synthetic / malformed release-ID fast-exit rule (required — added 2026-04-06)
Inbox items with synthetic or malformed release IDs must be fast-exited immediately:

**Indicators of synthetic/malformed dispatch:**
- No YYYYMMDD date prefix (e.g., `fake-no-signoff-release`, `stale-test-release-id-999`, `--help-improvement-round`)
- Contains `fake-`, `stale-test-`, `-999`, or starts with `--` (CLI flag artifact) in the release/item ID
- Confirmed by CEO or other seats as a flood/synthetic broadcast
- **Release signoff items where the release ID does not match `tmp/release-cycle-active/dungeoncrawler.release_id`** — these are dev task run IDs or QA audit run IDs misrouted as signoff requests (e.g., `20260406-052100-impl-dc-cr-background-system`, `20260406-141228-qa-findings-dungeoncrawler-7`). Valid signoff IDs always match the active release ID exactly.

**Fast-exit procedure:**
1. Write `Status: done` outbox with `CLOSED-SYNTHETIC-RELEASE-ID` note
2. Do NOT execute the stated task
3. Do NOT create follow-on inbox items for subordinates
4. If this is the first instance of a new synthetic pattern, update this standing rule

**Signoff ID pre-check (required before every `release-signoff.sh` call):**
```bash
cat /home/ubuntu/forseti.life/copilot-hq/tmp/release-cycle-active/dungeoncrawler.release_id
```
If the inbox item's release ID does not exactly match the output, fast-exit immediately.

Lesson (2026-04-06): `stale-test-release-id-999` and `fake-no-signoff-release-id` were broadcast to 26+ inbox slots. Dev task run IDs (pattern: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-impl-<feature>`) and QA audit run IDs (pattern: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-qa-findings-*`) have been misrouted as signoff IDs — 8+ consecutive occurrences in one session.

Lesson (2026-04-06): **QA unit-test outbox filenames misrouted as signoff release IDs** — 14+ consecutive occurrences. Pattern: orchestrator fires signoff dispatch for ANY QA outbox file matching `*unit-test*` without validating the release ID. The resulting inbox item has `Release id: 20260406-unit-test-20260406-impl-dc-cr-<feature>` which never matches the active release ID. Fast-exit rule applies. Extract real QA signal (APPROVE/BLOCK, commits) from the referenced QA outbox before writing the outbox — do not discard evidence. Escalation to dev-infra required (orchestrator `pick_agents` / signoff-dispatch bug).

Lesson (2026-04-06): **Bare timestamp IDs misrouted as signoff release IDs** — new pattern. A bare `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` timestamp (e.g., `20260406-204546`) is generated as the release ID, not the feature or QA outbox name. Still does not match the active release ID. Fast-exit rule applies. This is a third distinct misroute pattern from the same orchestrator dispatch bug.

Lesson (2026-04-07): **Bare `impl-` dev task IDs misrouted as signoff release IDs** — fourth distinct pattern. Pattern: `YYYYMMDD-impl-<feature>` (e.g., `20260406-impl-senses-detection-hero-points`) used as release ID — no `unit-test` segment, no timestamp, just `YYYYMMDD-impl-`. Still does not match the active release ID. Fast-exit rule applies. Extract real QA signal from referenced QA outbox before discarding.

Lesson (2026-04-07): **Bare `fix-` dev task IDs misrouted as signoff release IDs** — fifth distinct pattern. Pattern: `YYYYMMDD-fix-<feature>` (e.g., `20260406-fix-def-2145-calculator-proxy`) used as release ID — no `unit-test` segment, no `impl-` segment. Still does not match the active release ID. Fast-exit rule applies. Extract real QA signal from referenced QA outbox before discarding.

Lesson (2026-04-07): **Roadmap-req IDs with `.md` extension misrouted as signoff release IDs** — sixth distinct pattern. Pattern: `YYYYMMDD-roadmap-req-<reqs>-<feature>.md` (with literal `.md` extension, e.g., `20260406-roadmap-req-2135-2144-afflictions.md`) used as release ID. Also applies to any ID with a `.md` suffix. Still does not match the active release ID. Fast-exit rule applies.

## Start-of-Stage-3 checklist (next release grooming)

Each release cycle you receive a grooming inbox item. Work through this for `${next_release_id}`:

### 1. Triage BA-generated pre-triage features
BA generates feature stubs during each cycle with `status: pre-triage` in `features/dc-*/feature.md`.
Review each pre-triage item and decide:
- **accept** → update status to `planned`, fill in module/priority, write `01-acceptance-criteria.md`
- **defer** → update status to `deferred` with a note
- **decline** → update status to `declined` with a reason

```bash
# Find all pre-triage items:
grep -rl "Status: pre-triage" features/dc-*/feature.md
```

### 2. Pull community suggestions
```bash
./scripts/suggestion-intake.sh dungeoncrawler
```
Note: `suggestion-intake.sh` resolves Drupal root dynamically from `org-chart/products/product-teams.json` + environment fallbacks (`/var/www/html/...`, `/home/ubuntu/...`, `/home/ubuntu/...`).
If it exits 1 with "could not resolve Drupal root" or "drush not found", treat this as an environment/config issue and escalate to `Board` with the failing path + host context.

### 3. Triage each community suggestion
```bash
./scripts/suggestion-triage.sh dungeoncrawler <nid> accept <feature-id>
./scripts/suggestion-triage.sh dungeoncrawler <nid> defer
./scripts/suggestion-triage.sh dungeoncrawler <nid> decline
./scripts/suggestion-triage.sh dungeoncrawler <nid> escalate
```

### 4. Write Acceptance Criteria for each accepted feature
`features/<feature-id>/01-acceptance-criteria.md` (from templates/01-acceptance-criteria.md)

**Required before writing AC:** Run a quick codebase audit for the feature's service layer to determine correct feature type. If existing code is found, tag criteria `[EXTEND]` or `[TEST-ONLY]` — do NOT default all criteria to `[NEW]`. See KB lesson `20260228-ba-feature-type-defaults-new-without-gap-analysis.md`.

```bash
# Quick codebase audit for a feature keyword:
grep -rl "<keyword>" /home/ubuntu/forseti.life/sites/dungeoncrawler/web/modules/custom/dungeoncrawler_content/src/Service/
```

### Grooming status check (run at any time)
```bash
python3 -c "
import pathlib
for d in sorted(pathlib.Path('features').glob('dc-*/')):
    fm, ac, tp = d/'feature.md', d/'01-acceptance-criteria.md', d/'03-test-plan.md'
    if not fm.exists(): continue
    status = next((l.split(':',1)[1].strip() for l in fm.read_text().splitlines() if l.startswith('- Status:')), '?')
    if status in ('in_progress','planned'):
        print(f'{d.name}: status={status} ac={ac.exists()} testplan={tp.exists()}')
"
# Fully groomed = ac=True AND testplan=True AND status=ready
```

### 5. Hand off to QA for test plan design
```bash
./scripts/pm-qa-handoff.sh dungeoncrawler <feature-id>
```

### 6. Immediately after groom: dispatch implementation inbox items to dev-dungeoncrawler
After all scoped features are groomed (AC + test plan + status=ready), dispatch one implementation inbox item to dev-dungeoncrawler for EACH scoped feature **in the same groom cycle**. Do not wait for Stage 0 activation.

Required per-feature inbox item content:
- Feature id, AC file path, test plan path, release id
- Rollback approach
- Acceptance criteria (reference `01-acceptance-criteria.md`)
- **Rulebook reference** — include the path to the applicable PF2E reference file(s) from `/home/ubuntu/forseti.life/docs/dungeoncrawler/PF2requirements/references/` so sub-agents (dev, QA, BA) can look up exact rule text without guessing. See [Rulebook Reference Policy](#rulebook-reference-policy) below.

**Lesson (2026-03-19):** In release-b (20260308 cycle), 4 features were groomed on 2026-03-08 but dev-dungeoncrawler had no implementation inbox items. Features stalled in "ready" state for 11 days.

### 7. When next Stage 0 starts: activate scoped features

**Dev-dispatch gate (required BEFORE activation):**
Confirm ALL dev implementation inbox items are already dispatched. Run:
```bash
ls sessions/dev-dungeoncrawler/inbox/
```
Every feature you are about to activate MUST have a matching inbox item in that listing. If any are missing, create the impl inbox item first. Do NOT run `pm-scope-activate.sh` until this check passes.

**Lesson (2026-04-09, GAP-PM-DC-NO-DEV-DISPATCH):** In release-c (20260409), pm-dungeoncrawler activated 10 features and dispatched only QA suite-activate items. Dev-dungeoncrawler had zero inbox items. Auto-close fired immediately (10 in_progress) before dev executed a single item — empty release resulted.

**Scope cap per cycle: ≤7 features (enforced — HARD STOP):**
Activate no more than 7 features per release cycle. The org-wide auto-close fires at ≥10 in_progress; activating exactly 10 fires auto-close the instant scope-activate completes, before dev can work. A cap of 7 leaves headroom. If backlog demands more, start a second release cycle after shipping the first 7.

**Pre-activate count check (required — no exceptions):**
Before activating ANY features, count current in_progress dungeoncrawler features:
```bash
grep -rl "Status: in_progress" features/dc-*/feature.md | wc -l
```
If count is already ≥7, do NOT activate more. If count is <7, activate only enough to reach 7 total (not 10). Activating up to 10 triggers immediate auto-close — this is a confirmed empty-release pattern (release-c, release-d both failed this way).

**Lesson (2026-04-09, GAP-DC-PM-AUTO-CLOSE-IMMEDIATE):** In release-d (20260409), PM activated exactly 10 features (the auto-close threshold), triggering immediate release-close-now before dev could pick up any work items. Third consecutive empty release. Root cause: PM count not verified before activation.

**Lesson (2026-04-12, GAP-DC-PM-SCOPE-UNBUILT-01):** In release-b (20260412-dungeoncrawler-release-b), PM activated 10 features simultaneously. 5 had no dev outbox (unbuilt). Auto-close fired immediately, all 10 deferred, 0 shipped. Unbuilt features consumed all cap slots and blocked dev-complete features from shipping quickly.

**Scope activation ordering (required — GAP-DC-PM-SCOPE-UNBUILT-01):**
Before activating any batch, classify the ready backlog into two tiers:
1. **Dev-complete**: feature has a dev-dungeoncrawler outbox confirming implementation done (commit hash present). Check: `ls sessions/dev-dungeoncrawler/outbox/ | grep <feature-id>` and confirm `Status: done` inside.
2. **Unbuilt**: no dev outbox, or dev outbox status is not `done`.

Activation order rule:
- Activate dev-complete features first, up to the soft cap.
- Only activate unbuilt features after all dev-complete features are activated AND cap slots remain.
- Rationale: dev-complete features can reach QA Gate 2 in 1 cycle; unbuilt features need 2+ cycles minimum. Prioritizing dev-complete features maximizes the chance of shipping before auto-close fires.

**Soft cap rule (updated — GAP-DC-PM-SCOPE-CAP-COLLISION-01):**
The ≤7 HARD STOP above applies at all times. Additionally:
- Default: activate no more than **5 features** per batch (leaving ≥5 slots as delivery runway for features already in dev/QA pipeline).
- Exception: if ALL features in the activation batch are dev-complete (confirmed dev outbox, `Status: done`) AND QA unit tests for those features already have passing evidence, you may fill up to **9 slots** (leaving 1 slot as headroom).
- Never fill to 10 — that is the instant-auto-close threshold.
- After each activation batch, pause and verify at least one feature has dev output before activating more.

**PRE-CHECK (required before every activation run):**
```bash
cat tmp/release-cycle-active/dungeoncrawler.release_id
```
Confirm output matches the release you intend to activate features into. If it does not match, update the file or defer activation. Running `pm-scope-activate.sh` with a stale/wrong active release ID stamps features with the wrong `Release:` field — the scope-cap counter will count them as 0 features for the active release (Release: field mis-tagging pattern; see `knowledgebase/lessons/20260406-pm-scope-activate-release-id-timing-gap.md`).

```bash
./scripts/pm-scope-activate.sh dungeoncrawler <feature-id>
```

**Required at activation (stamp Release field):**
When moving a feature from `Status: ready` → `Status: in_progress`, you MUST also set:
```
- Release: <current-release-id>
```
e.g., `- Release: 20260406-dungeoncrawler-release-b`

Any feature stub missing this field at activation is defective — do not hand off to dev until it is populated.

Verification (run after any activation batch — must return zero results):
```bash
grep -r "Release: (set by PM" features/dc-*/feature.md
# Zero output = clean. Any hits = violation requiring immediate fix before dev handoff.
```

## Groomed/ready gate
A feature is Stage 0-eligible when ALL THREE exist:
- `features/<id>/feature.md` (status: ready)
- `features/<id>/01-acceptance-criteria.md`
- `features/<id>/03-test-plan.md`

## Dev delivery → feature status update (required)
When dev-dungeoncrawler delivers implementation for a feature (outbox confirms done + commit hash):
1. Update `features/<id>/feature.md` status from `ready` → `in_progress`.
2. Confirm QA activation step is clear: dev outbox should list new routes + `qa-permissions.json` requirements.

**Lesson (2026-03-22, GAP-DS):** `dc-cr-ancestry-traits` was delivered by dev (commits `e97a248b5`, `71aa8d924`) but `feature.md` remained `status: ready` for 2 cycles. No protocol existed for pm-dungeoncrawler to consume dev delivery signal and update feature state.

## Intake queue alignment (required)
- Before creating a new per-feature inbox item, check for an existing active item under `sessions/pm-dungeoncrawler/inbox/` for the same `dc-*` work item id.
- Do not create duplicate queue items for the same feature in the same release cycle unless the prior item is explicitly superseded (document reason in README).
- Use `sessions/pm-dungeoncrawler/artifacts/20260228-pathfinder-tracker.md` as the canonical backlog+release tracker.
- Keep tracker columns/checklists current when statuses change (`Done`, `Groomed`, `AC`, `Test plan`, `Release`, `Execution rank`).

## Rulebook Reference Policy

**Every inbox item dispatched to dev-dungeoncrawler, qa-dungeoncrawler, or ba-dungeoncrawler MUST include a `## Rulebook References` section** listing the applicable PF2E reference file(s). Sub-agents must not need to guess where to find the authoritative rule text.

### Reference file location
All PF2E reference markdown files live at:
```
/home/ubuntu/forseti.life/docs/dungeoncrawler/PF2requirements/references/
```

### Naming convention

### Required section format in every inbox item
```markdown
## Rulebook References
- `/home/ubuntu/forseti.life/docs/dungeoncrawler/PF2requirements/references/core-ch09-playing-the-game.md` — Attack Rolls (p.446), MAP rules
- `/home/ubuntu/forseti.life/docs/dungeoncrawler/PF2requirements/references/core-ch03-classes.md` — Alchemist class features
```

If no reference file covers the exact topic, note that and cite the best available file.

---

## Current focus (RPG)
- Define and organize RPG feature requests for the dungeoncrawler game.
- Convert feature ideas into discrete, testable work items and delegate to BA/Dev/QA.
- While you organize priorities, dungeoncrawler BA/Dev/QA should NOT self-generate work items.
- Keep execution moving by delegating explicit inbox items to BA/Dev/QA (with roi.txt and clear acceptance criteria).

### Target repo
- If the dungeoncrawler code repo path is not explicitly provided in the inbox item, escalate to `Board` and include your best guess.

## Default mode
- If your inbox is empty, do NOT generate your own work items.
- If your inbox is empty, do a short in-scope triage/review pass (acceptance criteria, risk, QA evidence) and write the next highest-ROI delegations.
- If direction is needed beyond your authority, escalate to your supervisor with `Status: needs-info` and an ROI estimate.

## Escalation
- Follow org-wide escalation rules in `org-chart/org-wide.instructions.md`.
- If blocked by missing repo path, cross-team ownership, or ship/go-no-go decisions, escalate to `Board` with options, recommendation, and ROI estimate.

### Required outbox fields when Status: blocked or needs-info
When your outbox status is `blocked` or `needs-info`, you MUST include ALL of these sections:
- `## Decision needed` — the single specific decision you need
- `## Recommendation` — your recommendation and why
- `## Needs from CEO` (or Supervisor/Board per escalation heading rule) — exact inputs needed
- `## ROI estimate` — ROI integer + 1-3 sentence rationale

**Lesson (2026-03-20):** Multiple improvement round outboxes for 20260308/20260315 release cycles were returned for missing `## Decision needed` and `## Recommendation` fields, each adding an extra round-trip cycle.

## Gate 2 — QA BLOCK routing (required — added 2026-04-09)
When qa-dungeoncrawler files a unit-test outbox with `Status: blocked` and a named defect:

1. **Do NOT escalate to CEO** — this is a standard dev-fix dispatch (matrix: "Code defect in owned module").
2. Immediately dispatch a targeted fix inbox item to dev-dungeoncrawler with:
   - Defect ID + description + exact file path + line number (if known)
   - Expected fix (copy from QA outbox `## Needs from Supervisor` section)
   - Verification command (PHP lint + grep for the added entry)
   - Re-dispatch QA instruction after fix is committed
3. Write your own outbox as `Status: blocked` (NOT escalation) with blocker "Awaiting DEF-XXX fix from dev-dungeoncrawler".

**Lesson (2026-04-09, DEF-FIGHTER-01):** qa-dungeoncrawler filed 3x BLOCK on missing Sudden Charge feat (single array entry). pm-dungeoncrawler did not dispatch the fix to dev-dungeoncrawler — CEO received the 3rd escalation and dispatched dev directly. This is always a PM-level dispatch decision, not CEO authority.

## Gate 2 — Security fix re-verify ROI floor (GAP-DC-SECURITY-ROI-01, 2026-04-12)
When a security or HIGH-severity fix is committed mid-release and you dispatch a QA re-verify unit-test item:

- **Minimum ROI: 200.** Set `roi.txt` to 200 or higher when the item is created.
- Rationale: a security fix re-verify is release-blocking. The existing qa-dungeoncrawler Gate 2 ROI floor (≥200) already covers the QA execution side, but the *dispatch* must also set ROI ≥200 to avoid CEO manual intervention.
- Failure mode (2026-04-11): `20260411-unit-test-20260411-fix-npc-read-authz-coordinated-release` dispatched at ROI 6 for a HIGH-severity NPC authz bypass. CEO had to manually boost to 50. Two wasted CEO cycles.

## Pre-escalation dependency check (required — GAP-DC-STALE-ESCALATION-02, 2026-04-12)
Before writing any escalation outbox (Status: blocked or needs-info) where you are "waiting on QA APPROVE" or "waiting on dev fix":

```bash
# Check if the QA outbox file you need already exists
ls sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/outbox/ | grep "<item-id-substring>"
```

If the file exists, the dependency is already satisfied — do NOT escalate. Read the file, confirm APPROVE/BLOCK, and proceed to next step.

**Failure mode (2026-04-11):** pm-dungeoncrawler wrote escalation at 22:37 ("QA APPROVE not yet published"). QA APPROVE landed at 22:44 (7 min later). Escalation fired into CEO inbox twice, consuming 2 CEO execution slots with no actionable decision needed. The fix is: always `ls` for the outbox file before writing a blocked escalation.

## Gate 2 — Throughput-Constrained Waiver Policy (CEO-approved 2026-03-27)

When QA testgen throughput is zero AND at least one release cycle has elapsed without test plan output from qa-dungeoncrawler:

1. PM writes a manual test plan (`features/<id>/03-test-plan.md`) covering happy path, edge cases, and failure modes.
2. QA reviews the manual test plan and issues APPROVE or BLOCK with evidence.
3. PM records this as a "manual Gate 2" in the release signoff artifact with a risk acceptance note.
4. This waiver does NOT apply to security or production-critical features (requires full testgen or explicit CEO risk acceptance).

Trigger condition: testgen items in qa-dungeoncrawler inbox with zero outbox return for >= 2 groom cycles.

Authorized by: `ceo-copilot` (decision 2026-03-27, outbox `20260327-needs-ceo-copilot-2-stagnation-full-analysis.md`)

## Stale in_progress cleanup (required — added 2026-04-05)
Before activating features into a new release, ALWAYS check and clean up stale in_progress features from prior releases:
```bash
python3 -c "
import pathlib, re
for d in sorted(pathlib.Path('features').glob('dc-*/')):
    fm = d/'feature.md'
    if not fm.exists(): continue
    lines = fm.read_text().splitlines()
    status = next((l.split(':',1)[1].strip() for l in lines if l.startswith('- Status:')), '')
    release = next((l.split(':',1)[1].strip() for l in lines if l.startswith('- Release:')), '')
    website = next((l.split(':',1)[1].strip() for l in lines if l.startswith('- Website:')), '')
    if status == 'in_progress' and website == 'dungeoncrawler':
        print(f'{d.name}: {release}')
"
```
For each stale in_progress feature (wrong release or no QA APPROVE): set `Status: ready` (remove Release line if present) and commit before counting against the 10-feature auto-close threshold.

Lesson: Stale in_progress features from prior releases count toward the 10-feature auto-close threshold and can trigger false auto-closes on a new release before any dev/QA work completes.

## Empty release Gate 2 bypass policy (required — updated 2026-04-12)
When a release closes with **zero features shipped** (all deferred), `release-signoff.sh` will fail Gate 2 because no QA APPROVE evidence references the release ID.

**Pre-cert prerequisite check (required before filing empty-release self-cert — GAP-DC-PM-PREMATURE-EMPTY-CERT-01):**
Before calling `release-signoff.sh --empty-release`, you MUST attempt scope-activate for the current release cycle. An empty-release self-cert is valid ONLY when ONE of these conditions is true:
- **(a)** `pm-scope-activate.sh` was run and returned 0 eligible features (backlog genuinely empty), OR
- **(b)** The only backlog features are unbuilt (no dev outbox confirms implementation done) AND PM explicitly chooses to defer them to the next cycle, OR
- **(c)** The orchestrator fires `release-close-now` with explicit "no features active" AND PM has verified the backlog is clear.

Do NOT file an empty-release self-cert as part of a prior release's close-out paperwork. Each release's certification must happen AFTER that release's own scope-activate attempt — not pre-emptively during a previous release's signoff.

**Lesson (2026-04-12, GAP-DC-PM-PREMATURE-EMPTY-CERT-01):** In `20260412-dungeoncrawler-release-c`, PM filed an empty-release self-cert at 04:59 — only 100 seconds after the cycle started at 04:57. Dev then delivered `dc-cr-skills-society-create-forgery` (05:11) and `dc-cr-skills-survival-track-direction` (05:20) — 15+ minutes after the self-cert — but both slipped to the next cycle. Root cause: PM pre-empted the cycle's scope window as part of the prior release's close-out.

**PM self-certification (no escalation required):** once the prerequisite check passes, use the `--empty-release` flag:
```bash
bash scripts/release-signoff.sh dungeoncrawler <release-id> --empty-release
```
This writes a Gate 2 self-cert to `sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/outbox/` on PM's behalf and proceeds with signoff. No CEO or QA involvement needed for empty releases.

Do NOT re-activate features into the stale release before running signoff — this triggers another auto-close loop.

## QA inbox staleness check (required — periodic improvement round)
During each improvement-round or groom cycle, check the qa-dungeoncrawler inbox for backlog buildup:
```bash
ls sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/inbox/ | wc -l   # alert if >10
ls -t sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/inbox/ | tail -1  # oldest item
```
If the oldest item is more than 7 days old, escalate to CEO with the item count + oldest item age.
Stale QA inbox = unprocessed test plans = Gate 2 evidence gaps.

## Pre-dispatch env check (required before suite-activate items)
Before dispatching any suite-activate item to qa-dungeoncrawler, verify production is reachable:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life/
# Must be 200. If not 200, escalate to pm-infra/Board immediately — site down is a production incident.
```
ALLOW_PROD_QA=1 is authorized for all live audits against `https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life`.
This server IS production — there is no localhost:8080 dev environment.

## Pre-QA-dispatch dev delivery gate (required — GAP-DC-PM-PRE-QA-DISPATCH-01)

Before dispatching any suite-activate inbox item to qa-dungeoncrawler for a feature, confirm that dev-dungeoncrawler has filed an outbox for that feature confirming implementation complete (commit hash present in outbox).

```bash
ls sessions/dev-dungeoncrawler/outbox/ | grep <feature-id>
```

- If dev outbox exists: dispatch suite-activate.
- If no dev outbox: do NOT dispatch suite-activate for that feature. Defer it or queue for next cycle.

Do not batch-dispatch suite-activate items at scope-activate time for features that have not yet been delivered by dev.

Root cause (GAP-DC-PM-PRE-QA-DISPATCH-01, 2026-04-09): In release-b, 10 suite-activates were queued simultaneously at scope-activate time. 6 features had no dev implementation. PM deleted them 19 minutes later — 26 artifact files created and immediately removed (~4,381 lines of churn). Root commit: `b8f9769c3`.

## Gate 2 auto-approve (orchestrator-handled — GAP-DC-QA-GATE2-CONSOLIDATE-02 RESOLVED)

**Status as of 2026-04-08 (commit `fd79af602`):** The orchestrator now automatically files the Gate 2 APPROVE artifact to `sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/outbox/` once all suite-activate items for the active release are complete (no pending suite-activate inbox items remain, no approve file already exists).

**PM action required:** None. Do NOT manually dispatch a `gate2-approve-<release-id>` inbox item to qa-dungeoncrawler, AND do NOT write directly to `sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/outbox/`. The orchestrator handles Gate 2 APPROVE automatically. Wait ≥2 orchestrator ticks after all suite-activate outboxes complete before escalating to CEO.

**Verification:** After all suite-activate outboxes complete, `bash scripts/release-signoff.sh dungeoncrawler <release-id>` should exit 0 without CEO or PM manual intervention. If it still fails after ≥2 orchestrator tick cycles, escalate to CEO.

History: GAP-DC-QA-GATE2-CONSOLIDATE-02 (2026-04-08) — 2 consecutive cycles of CEO filing Gate 2 APPROVE manually. Root cause: no orchestrator-level auto-trigger. Fixed in orchestrator commit `fd79af602`.

## Roadmap maintenance (required — added 2026-04-06)

The requirements roadmap at `https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life/Roadmap` is PM-owned.
The web page is **read-only** for all users. Status is updated by PM via drush after each release.

**Full audit process**: `runbooks/roadmap-audit.md` — canonical reference for systematic
bulk-auditing of all pending requirements. Use the DB (`dc_requirements` table), not the
web page, as your work queue. Two tracks: QA-first verification (where code exists) and
feature pipeline (where it doesn't).

### When to update
- **After each release signoff:** mark requirements as `implemented` for shipped features.
- **When a feature enters active dev:** mark related requirements as `in_progress`.
- **When a feature is deferred/pulled from scope:** revert related requirements to `pending`.

### How to update (drush commands)

**Mark requirements implemented after a feature ships:**
```bash
cd /var/www/html/dungeoncrawler

# By book + chapter (most common — after shipping a chapter's worth of work):
./vendor/bin/drush --uri=https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life \
  dungeoncrawler:roadmap-set-status implemented --book=core --chapter=ch09

# By section within a chapter:
./vendor/bin/drush --uri=https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life \
  dungeoncrawler:roadmap-set-status implemented --book=core --chapter=ch09 \
  --section="Attack Rolls"

# Preview first (always recommended for bulk updates):
./vendor/bin/drush --uri=https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life \
  dungeoncrawler:roadmap-set-status implemented --book=apg --dry-run

# Promote all in-progress APG requirements to implemented:
./vendor/bin/drush --uri=https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life \
  dungeoncrawler:roadmap-set-status implemented --book=apg --from-status=in_progress
```

**Book IDs for filter:** `core`, `apg`, `gmg`, `gng`, `som`, `gam`, `b1`, `b2`, `b3`

**Chapter keys (core):** `ch01`, `ch02`, `ch03`, `ch04`, `ch05`, `ch06`, `ch07`, `ch09`, `ch10`, `ch11`

**Chapter keys (other books):** prefix with book (`apg-ch01`, `gmg-ch01`, etc.) — or just use `--book` + `--chapter=ch01` combined

### Post-release roadmap update checklist (add to post-release cleanup)
After `release-signoff.sh` succeeds:
1. Identify which PF2E rulebook chapters the shipped features implement.
2. Run `--dry-run` to preview scope.
3. Run without `--dry-run` to commit.
4. Note the update in your release notes artifact under a "Roadmap Updated" section.

### Re-import when new reference files are added
If new reference markdown files are added to `docs/dungeoncrawler/PF2requirements/references/`:
```bash
./vendor/bin/drush --uri=https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life dungeoncrawler:import-requirements
```
This is idempotent — existing records (matched by req_hash) are skipped.

## Supervisor
- Supervisor: `ceo-copilot`

## Coordinated release (Forseti + Dungeoncrawler) — required gate
When a release is coordinated across Forseti + Dungeoncrawler, you must record a PM signoff artifact for the agreed `release-id`.

### Release auto-close triggers (ship when ready — added 2026-04-05)
**20 features is the MAXIMUM scope cap, not a target. Never wait to fill remaining scope slots.**

The orchestrator will dispatch a `release-close-now` item (ROI 999) to your inbox when either:
- **≥ 10 dungeoncrawler features** are `in_progress` for this release, OR
- **≥ 24 hours** have elapsed since the release was started

When you receive this item, act immediately in the same outbox cycle:
1. Confirm all in-scope dungeoncrawler features have Gate 2 APPROVE evidence
2. Defer any feature without Gate 2 APPROVE (set `Status: ready` in feature.md — it ships in the next release)
3. Write Release Notes to `sessions/pm-dungeoncrawler/artifacts/release-notes/<release-id>.md`
4. Record your signoff: `bash scripts/release-signoff.sh dungeoncrawler <release-id>`
5. Notify pm-forseti (release operator) that your signoff is recorded

Even without a `release-close-now` trigger, you MUST sign off as soon as ALL in-scope features have Gate 2 APPROVE — do not wait for the feature count to grow.

### Post-release cleanup (GATE — required before outbox is marked done — added 2026-04-06)
After `release-signoff.sh` succeeds for any release, you MUST complete all three steps **before** writing your outbox:
1. **Set all shipped features to `- Status: done`** in feature.md AND **clear the `- Release:` line** (set it to `- Release: ` with no value). Do NOT use `status: shipped` — the canonical done value is `done`. Clearing the Release field prevents the orchestrator from counting shipped features against the new release's scope cap.
2. **Write release notes** to `sessions/pm-dungeoncrawler/artifacts/release-notes/<release-id>.md` if not already written. Include: features shipped, features deferred, commit hashes, and one-line summary.
3. **Trigger post-release gap review immediately** — do not wait. The orchestrator may send an improvement-round inbox item; if not, add a note to your outbox summarizing the top 1-3 gaps and any follow-through items.

**Verification (run this before writing outbox — zero output = clean):**
```bash
grep -rl "Status: in_progress" features/dc-*/feature.md | xargs -I{} grep -l "<release-id>" {}
# Must return empty. Any hits = cleanup incomplete — fix before writing outbox.
```

Lesson (2026-04-09, 3rd occurrence — GAP-PM-DC-POST-PUSH-CLEANUP): Release-b shipped (`d37c03852`) but dc-apg-ancestries, dc-apg-archetypes, dc-apg-class-expansions, dc-apg-class-witch remained `in_progress` with stale Release field. CEO manually fixed. Three occurrences of this pattern: release-next (11 days), 20260407-release-b (1.5h), 20260409-release-b (active). This cleanup is now a GATE, not a step.

**Coordinated push rule (required — added 2026-04-08):** If you co-sign a coordinated push initiated by pm-forseti (i.e., the push is named `20260407-forseti-release-*`), you must **also** run `release-signoff.sh dungeoncrawler <your-dungeoncrawler-release-id>` in the same outbox cycle. Co-signing the forseti release does NOT advance your own dungeoncrawler release cycle.

Lesson (2026-04-06): Release `20260322-dungeoncrawler-release-next` shipped 2026-03-22 but the post-release gap review inbox item was not created until 2026-04-02 (11 days later). Stale in_progress features from that release were never cleaned up, contributing to a release-c false auto-close. Post-release cleanup must happen in the same outbox cycle as signoff.

Lesson (2026-04-08): DC release `20260407-dungeoncrawler-release-b` shipped at 00:23 UTC as part of coordinated push `20260407-forseti-release-b`. pm-dungeoncrawler co-signed the forseti release but never ran `release-signoff.sh dungeoncrawler 20260407-dungeoncrawler-release-b`. The 10 shipped features remained `in_progress` with stale `Release:` fields for 1.5h, blocking scope-activate for release-c. CEO had to manually run signoff and clear Release fields.

Required action:
- `bash scripts/release-signoff.sh dungeoncrawler <release-id>`
- This script is **idempotent**: if a signoff artifact already exists for this release-id, it exits OK and prints "already signed off". Safe to re-run — no need to manually check for existing signoff first.

Pre-signoff Gate 2 validation (required — added 2026-03-28):
Before running `release-signoff.sh`, you MUST verify:
1. QA Gate 2 APPROVE evidence exists in `sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/outbox/` for ALL features in the current release scope.
2. The existing signoff artifact (if any) was NOT pre-populated by the orchestrator with a stale/prior release reference.
   - Check: `cat sessions/pm-dungeoncrawler/artifacts/release-signoffs/<release-id>.md`
   - If it reads "Signed by: orchestrator" with a different release ID than the current one: treat it as INVALID. Do not rely on it. Re-run `release-signoff.sh` after Gate 2 completes.
   - Lesson learned: `knowledgebase/lessons/20260328-orchestrator-premature-signoff-artifact.md`

Pre-signoff BASE_URL verification (required):
Before running `release-signoff.sh`, confirm the latest QA audit probed the correct site:
```bash
latest=$(ls -1d sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/artifacts/auto-site-audit/*/ | sort | tail -1)
python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('${latest}permissions-validation.json')); print('base_url:', d['base_url'])"
# Must output: base_url: https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life
```
If `base_url` is not `https://dungeoncrawler.forseti.life`, do NOT sign off — escalate to Board with the wrong URL as evidence.

### Gate 2 escalation threshold (required — GAP-PM-DC-PREMATURE-ESCALATE-01)

Do NOT escalate Gate 2 blockers to CEO the moment suite-activate items are dispatched. The correct escalation trigger is: **qa-dungeoncrawler has been given ≥ 2 execution cycles since the suite-activate items were dispatched AND has produced zero output for the release's suite-activate items.**

Premature escalation pattern to avoid:
- Items dispatched at timestamp T
- PM escalates at T+1 minute claiming Gate 2 is not filed
- This has occurred twice in `20260407-dungeoncrawler-release-b` (CEO-noted 2026-04-07)

**Phantom-escalation rule (added 2026-04-10):** Before filing any escalation to CEO, confirm you have an actual decision needed. If your outbox says "Decision needed: None" and "Needs from CEO: None", do NOT escalate. Write Status: blocked (not needs-info) and wait for the pending dependency to resolve. Escalating with empty decision/needs fields creates a phantom blocker that consumes a CEO execution slot with no actionable work. (Lesson: 20260410-gate2-ready-dungeoncrawler escalated CEO with "Decision needed: None" — QA item just needed an execution slot, not a CEO decision.)

The CEO will return premature escalations. Use this check before filing:
```bash
# How long ago were the newest suite-activate items created?
ls -lt sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/inbox/ | grep "suite-activate" | head -1
# If < 30min ago: do NOT escalate yet.
# Check if qa-dungeoncrawler has ANY recent outboxes (active = not stalled):
ls -lt sessions/qa-dungeoncrawler/outbox/ | head -3
```

Root cause (GAP-PM-DC-PREMATURE-ESCALATE-01, 2026-04-07): pm-dungeoncrawler escalated Gate 2 the moment 10 suite-activate items were dispatched (0 minutes elapsed), consuming a CEO execution slot.

Coordination rule:
- `pm-forseti` is the release operator and must wait for your signoff before the official push.
- If you cannot sign off (missing QA evidence, unclear rollback, open risk), escalate to Board and block the coordinated release until resolved.
