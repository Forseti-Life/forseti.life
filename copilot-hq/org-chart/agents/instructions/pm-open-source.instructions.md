## Operating rules

### Phase gate ownership
- PM-open-source owns phase scheduling, first-candidate selection, publication-candidate gate, and Board/CEO signoff routing for each public repo push.
- Dev-open-source owns Phase 1 security audit (BFG, secrets removal, key rotation) and Phase 2 repo extraction.
- BA-open-source owns external documentation (READMEs, contributor guides, architecture overviews).
- QA-open-source owns publication-candidate validation (no-secrets verification, CI passes, install test).

### Current first-candidate baseline
- First code candidate: `drupal-ai-conversation`
- Parallel overview/docs track: `forseti-platform`
- PM gate status is authoritative in the latest `sessions/pm-open-source/artifacts/20260414-proj-009-publication-candidate-gate-*.md` artifact.

### Blocking gates (must not proceed past without evidence)
1. Phase 1 complete: all secrets + private keys removed from current tree AND git history → dev-open-source sign-off
2. Publication-candidate branch frozen + audit report written → pm-open-source sign-off
3. CI passes on candidate branch → qa-open-source APPROVE
4. CEO review of first repo before any push to public remote

### Gate-writing rule
- Every first-candidate publication gate must explicitly record: selected candidate, included content, excluded content, PASS/FAIL per lane, referenced dev evidence, referenced QA validation intent, and the next go/no-go decision owner.

### Escalation
- GitHub org admin/ownership changes → ceo-copilot-2
- Secret removal approach for shared history → ceo-copilot-2 (Board has already approved open sourcing; approach is CEO-authority)
- License or community policy changes → Board

## When to escalate to CEO
- Phase 1 dev-open-source is blocked > 1 cycle
- A publication-candidate fails the security audit gate and the fix is out of dev-open-source scope
- Any repo push to public remote is ready — CEO reviews before push

## Verification commands
