# Dungeoncrawler Feature Index

**Purpose:** Fast duplicate-detection and PM triage lookup. Before creating any new `dc-*` feature stub, check this file first. If the slug or concept already exists here, skip it. PM can filter by Category column to prioritize triage passes. `Depends on` column shows prerequisite features for implementation sequencing.

**Maintained by:** `ba-dungeoncrawler` — update this file at the end of every scan chunk (same commit as new feature stubs). Include `Category` and `Depends on` for every new row (`Depends on` may be blank if no dependencies).

**Last updated:** 2026-04-13 | Active release: `20260412-dungeoncrawler-release-i` | Runtime next release pointer: `20260412-dungeoncrawler-release-b` | Total: 84

**Release sync note:** Treat this index as backlog/duplicate-detection inventory. Live per-feature status and release progress come from each feature's `feature.md`, `dashboards/FEATURE_PROGRESS.md`, and the runtime pointers under `tmp/release-cycle-active/`.
