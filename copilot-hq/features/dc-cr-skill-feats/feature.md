## Goal

Provide the catalog of skill feats that expand what a character can do with each skill (e.g., Battle Medicine for Medicine, Kip Up for Acrobatics, Intimidating Glare for Intimidation). Skill feats are taken at even levels for most classes and require a specific skill proficiency as a prerequisite. They make skill investment feel meaningful and rewarding.

## Source reference

> "This chapter includes skill feats, which are tied directly to your skills." (Chapter 5: Feats)

## Implementation hint

Reuses the `feat` content type (type = skill) with a required skill and minimum proficiency rank as prerequisite fields. Skill feat selection UI must filter by trained skill and rank. Background system also grants one skill feat at character creation. Each of the 17 skills has multiple associated skill feats spanning levels 1–7.
