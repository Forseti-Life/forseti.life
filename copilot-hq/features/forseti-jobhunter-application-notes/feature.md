## Summary

Job seekers tracking applications at `/jobhunter/my-jobs` have no place to record recruiter/hiring manager contact details or freetext notes per application. This feature adds a contact log and notes field per saved job, stored in a new `jobhunter_application_notes` table. Users can inline-edit notes from the job detail view without leaving the page.

Note: `jobhunter_interview_notes` (shipped in release-g) is interview-prep notes; this feature is distinct — it is for **application-tracking** notes (who to call, what was discussed, next steps).

## Goal

From the saved-job detail view, the user can:
1. Enter/edit: hiring manager name, contact email, last contact date, freetext notes
2. Save via CSRF-protected AJAX endpoint
3. See notes pre-populated on revisit

## Non-goals

- Calendar/reminder integration (future)
- Shared notes across users
- Interview prep notes (already handled by `jobhunter_interview_notes`)
