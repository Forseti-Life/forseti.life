## Goal

Implement the focus spell subsystem where certain classes and archetypes have a pool of Focus Points (max 3) used to cast focus spells without consuming spell slots. Focus Points recharge on a 10-minute rest (Refocus action). Focus spells auto-heighten to the character's highest spell level, making them consistently powerful throughout a campaign.

## Source reference

> "This section includes the rules for spellcasting, hundreds of spell descriptions, focus spells used by certain classes, and rituals." (Chapter 7: Spells)

## Implementation hint

Character entity fields: `focus_points` (current), `focus_points_max`. Focus spell content type reuses the `spell` content type with flag `is_focus_spell: true`. Refocus action API endpoint restores 1 focus point (up to max). Classes like Champion, Cleric, Druid, Monk, and Sorcerer each have class-specific focus spell pools.

## Mission alignment

- [x] Aligns with democratized community game experience
