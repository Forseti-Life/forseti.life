## Goal

Implement the Arctic Elf heritage granting cold resistance equal to half the character's level (minimum 1) and the ability to treat environmental cold severity as one step less extreme (incredible cold → extreme, extreme cold → severe, severe → moderate, etc.). This heritage enables cold-environment survival builds and interacts with the environmental hazard system.

## Source reference

> Arctic Elf — You dwell deep in the frozen north and have gained incredible resilience against cold environments, granting you cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).

## Implementation hint

Add `cold_resistance: half_level_min_1` to the character's damage resistance table when this heritage is selected. Implement an environmental-severity-downgrade hook: when the encounter engine applies cold environmental effects, check if the character has Arctic Elf and reduce the severity tier by one step before applying damage/conditions. Requires the hazards/environment system to expose a severity-tier modifier interface.

## Mission alignment

- [x] Aligns with democratized community game experience
