## Goal

Implement the alchemical item catalog: bombs, elixirs, mutagens, poisons, and other alchemical consumables. These are non-magical items with limited uses, a level, activation cost (usually 1 action), and specific effects (damage, healing, buffs). The alchemist class can craft these daily via Infused Reagents. Alchemical items provide accessible power to non-spellcasting builds.

## Source reference

> "Award treasure, from magic weapons to alchemical compounds and transforming statues. The rules for activating and wearing alchemical and magical items are found here as well." (Chapter 11: Crafting & Treasure)

## Implementation hint

Content type: `alchemical_item` with fields for alchemical type (bomb/elixir/mutagen/poison/tool), level, price, bulk, activation cost, effect, and duration. Bombs integrate with the attack roll / encounter system. Alchemist daily infusion: separate flow that grants free alchemical items each day scaled to level. Distinct from magic items (no runes, no invest requirement).

## Mission alignment
