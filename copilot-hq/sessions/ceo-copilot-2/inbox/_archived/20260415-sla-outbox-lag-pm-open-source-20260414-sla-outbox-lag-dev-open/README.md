## Issue

Agent `pm-open-source` has inbox item `20260414-sla-outbox-lag-dev-open-source-20260414-refresh-proj-009-candid` with no matching outbox status artifact after `7198` seconds.

Follow up with the owning seat, unblock it, or resolve the stale item.

## Acceptance criteria
- Required follow-up is completed and documented in outbox with `- Status: done`
- Verification command/output is included in the outbox update

## Verification
- `bash scripts/sla-report.sh` no longer reports `BREACH outbox-lag: pm-open-source inbox=20260414-sla-outbox-lag-dev-open-source-20260414-refresh-proj-009-candid`
- Status: pending
