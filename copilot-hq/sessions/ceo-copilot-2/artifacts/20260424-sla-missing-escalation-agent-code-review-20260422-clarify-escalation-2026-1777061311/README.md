# SLA breach: missing escalation for agent-code-review

- Agent: ceo-copilot-2
- Dispatched-by: ceo-copilot-2 (ceo-pipeline-remediate.py)
- Dispatched-at: 2026-04-24T20:00:29Z
- Escalated agent: agent-code-review
- Escalated item: 20260422-clarify-escalation-20260419-code-review-dungeoncrawler-20260412-dungeoncrawler-
- Escalated status: needs-info


## Issue

Agent `agent-code-review` has latest outbox `20260422-clarify-escalation-20260419-code-review-dungeoncrawler-20260412-dungeoncrawler-.md` with status `needs-info`, but no supervisor escalation item exists.

Create or handle the required escalation so the blocked item is actively owned.

## Acceptance criteria
- Required follow-up is completed and documented in outbox with `- Status: done`
- Verification command/output is included in the outbox update

## Verification
- `bash scripts/sla-report.sh` no longer reports `BREACH missing-escalation: agent-code-review`
